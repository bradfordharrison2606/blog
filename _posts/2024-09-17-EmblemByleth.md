# **Introduction**
Byleth represents the 1st Switch Era Fire Emblem Game: Three Houses. Byleth is an Emblem that is both simple and complex to use. While primarily a Support Emblem, he offers decent Combat abilities to his wearer. However, out of all the Emblems in the game, Byleth's gameplay whether for Support or Combat is heavily dependent on the Type of Unit wearing his ring. 

# **Initial Gameplay (Bond 1 - 10)** 

## Stat Bonuses

| **Bond Lv.** | **MAG** | **SPD** | **LUCK** |
| 1 | +1 | +1 | +2 |
| 2 | +1 | +1 | +4 |
| 6 | +2 | +1 | +4 |
| 7 | +2 | +2 | +4 |
| 8 | +2 | +2 | +6 |

Wearing the Ring of the Instructor boosts Magic, Speed, and Luck. This makes Byleth lean more towards Magical Units rather than Physical Ones. However, his boost to Luck is his biggest asset as it factors into one of his Sync Skills. 

## Sync Skills

| **Sync Skill** | **Bond Lv** | **Effect** |
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/byleth/FE17_Divine_Pulse_Icon.webp) <br> **Divine Pulse** | 1 | May turn a missed Attack/Status Staff into a hit. <br> Trigger% = 30 + (1 * LUCK) | 
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/byleth/FE17_Mentorship_Icon.webp) <br> **Mentorship** | 3 | Grants 1.2x EXP Modifier to Unit and adjacent Allies |


<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

You can think of <b>Divine Pulse</b> as an insurance policy against shaky hit rates. This makes Divine Pulse great for Units with mediocre DEX stats and shaky hit rates. <br><br>

Divine Pulse is a rather peculiar Sync Skill because there's more to how it works than its in-game description infers. No one seems to know how this skill works under the hood but I'm going to take an educated guess based on my knowledge of Fire Emblem and how its mechanics work. <br><br>

How Divine Pulse (likely) works is that, if an attack would have missed, this skill will make the game roll another random number and if that number falls within the range of Divine Pulse (30% + your Luck Stat) then that attack will hit. <br><br>

Think of Divine Pulse this way. If you have a 50% Hit Rate against an enemy, that becomes an 80% Hit Rate with Divine Pulse active (Assuming you have 0 Luck). If you intend to use Status Staves (Freeze, Entrap, etc.) with Micaiah's Augment, I highly recommend putting Divine Pulse on your main Micaiah User. This skill, combined with a Staff Mastery Skill from Micaiah will ensure your Status Staves rarely miss. <br><br>

However, Byleth's other Sync Skill <b>Mentorship</b> is just as, if not even more useful than Divine Pulse. That 20% boost to EXP gain makes Byleth great for grinding levels on not just himself but anyone standing next to him. Better, this EXP multiplier stacks with the EXP boost from Marth's Mercurius and Lucina's Parthia. <br><br>

Byleth enjoys standing next to people, not just for Mentorship but also for his Engage Form.

## Engage Skill

| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/byleth/FE17_Instruct_Icon.webp) <br> **Instruct** | Use to grant allies within 2 spaces a stat bonus based on user's type. Bonus lasts for 1 turn. |


|**Unit Type**|**Bonus**|
|Dragon| All seven basic Stats +3|
|Backup| STR+4|
|Cavalry |DEX+10 | 
|Covert |SPD+5 |
|Armored | DEF+5|
|Flying |RES+5 |
|Mystical |MAG+4 |
|Qi Adept |LUCK+10 |

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

If you're familiar with the Rally Skills from Awakening and Fates, then <b>Instruct</b> works the same way. It simply grants a stat boost to all allies within 2 spaces. What Stats are boosted depends on the Unit Type of Byleth's User and this gives Byleth a large degree of versatility. <br><br>

The main draw here is <b>Dragons</b> giving <b>+3 to all Stats</b>, effectively making this Rally Spectrum from Awakening. This makes Alear a great choice for Byleth as they lean more towards Support than Combat. However, feel free to play around with the other bonuses he grants and see what fits you as they are all incredibly useful. 

I recommend the <b>Covert, Backup, Armored, and Cavalry</b> Bonuses as their Stat boosts are incredibly useful in combat. <br><br>

The main drawback of Instruct is that, unlike Corrin's Dragon Vein which also based its effects on Unit Type, Instruct is only usable while Engaged with Byleth which only lasts 3-4 Turns. It also requires you to spend your turn and like Micaiah, Byleth's Turns while Engaged are better spent elsewhere, either attacking or using his amazing Engage Attack.

## Engage Attack

| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/byleth/FE17_Goddess_Dance_Icon.webp) <br> **Goddess Dance**  | Use to grant another action to all adjacent allies. <br> Refreshed Allies also receive the Instruct Buff. (See previous section) |


<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>
In Fire Emblem Dancers/Refreshers have been invaluable ever since their introduction and Byleth continues the trend. There is a lot of debate over which Emblem has the best Engage Attack. Byleth's Goddess Dance is usually a top contender for best Engage Attack in the game. 

If you're familiar with how Dancers worked in Genealogy of the Holy War, <b>Goddess Dance</b> works the exact same way, letting up to FOUR (4) members of your army have an additional action in the same turn. You'd be surprised how much you can get done in a single turn when 4 of your allies can move and act twice from rushing to Villages for rewards, killing up to 8 enemies with a squad of 4 allies, and beating Bosses with multiple health bars. The possibilities are endless.<br><br>

However, the most broken thing about Goddess Dance that the game doesn't tell you about is that it <b>REFRESHES DANCERS</b>. In other Fire Emblem Games (Mainly Heroes) Dancers/Refreshers cannot refresh other Dancers/Refreshers but Byleth bucks that trend. What this means is with clever strategy and positioning (which is easier with Sigurd's Canter) <b>you have up to SIX (6) allies getting an additional action in one turn</b>. How this works is like this. <br><br>

* Dancer Refreshes an Ally = <b>+1 Action</b> <br>
* Byleth Refreshes the Dancer and 3 other Allies = <b>+4 Actions</b> <br>
* Dancer Refreshes another Ally = <b>+1 Action</b> <br>
* Total = <b>+6 Actions</b>.<br><br> 

The base effect of Goddess Dance alone is already incredibly useful but as a bonus, anyone refreshed by Goddess Dance (and only those refreshed) also gets the Instruct Bonus. <br><br> 

If you thought Byleth couldn't get even crazier, just wait until you see Byleth's Engage Weapons.

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

When Byleth saw Leif, Eirika, and Corrin rocking 4 Engage Weapons instead of 3, he said "<b>Hold my Vulnerary.</b>". At Bond 1, every single Unit Type in the game gets a different Engage Weapon or Item from Byleth. This is another reason why Byleth's gameplay is heavily dependent on the type of Unit wearing his ring. <br><br>

First off, <b>Dragons</b> get <b>Aymr</b> which is incredibly hilarious and ironic if a certain ashen-haired emperor found out about this, she would mostly likely be seething. I don't see Aymr used much on Alear as they lean more toward Support than raw damage. <br><br>

<b>Blutgang for Backup Units</b> is another dud as it's a Magical Weapon and the majority of Backup Classes in Engage are primarily Physical attacks. Not only that, it has worse stats than a regular Levin Sword and can't attack at range. <br><br>

<b>Cavalry Units</b> get a better deal with <b>Areadbhar</b>. That +50% to Might is great as Cavalry Units have high mobility to reach their targets. Combine this with Sigurd's Momentum (which is good on Cavalry) and you could potentially one-shot enemies.<br><br>

<b>Covert Units get Failnaught</b> which is basically a Longbow on steroids with a great Critical Rate and a boost to Avoid which stacks with the doubled avoid bonus Covert Units get while in certain terrain. <br><br>

<b>Luin for Flying Units</b> is also an alright Engage Weapon. That boost to Damage based on Speed is more practical than you'd think as Flying Units like Griffin Knights or Wyvern Knights have pretty decent Speed stats. <br><br>

Byleth helps <b>Armored Units</b> double down on their role as Tanks with the <b>Aegis Shield</b>. The +6 Defence is great but don't expect that +3 Resistance to save them from their main weakness. Also, try not to rely on the Damage Reduction effect as Armored Units don't have the DEX stats to make this reliable.<br><br>

<b>Qi Adepts</b> get the <b>Rafail Gem</b> which is odd. The immunity to Critical Hits is nice but that immunity to Effectiveness damage mainly applies to Alear when reclasses as a Martial Monk/Master. It's nice but Dragon Effectiveness weapons like the Wyrmslayer are quite rare on the Enemy's side. <br><br>

Unfortunately, all of these weapons pale in comparison to the weapon Byleth gives to <b>Mystical Units; Thyrsus</b>. This item boosts the range of ALL tomes in the game. This includes Surge which is locked to 1 Range but will always hit. Thyrsus negates the one weakness of Surge tomes. It doesn't stop there as Thunder Tomes have their 3 Range increased to 5 Range. This makes Mystical Units into long-range snipers with Thoron and you never have to worry about retaliation from the enemy.  <br><br>

At Bond 10, everyone gets the <b>Vajra-Mushti</b>, an Arts Weapon that calculates damage using the lower of the Enemy's Defence and Resistance. It's a shame this isn't how all Arts Weapons work but this is still nice.

## Skill Inheritance 

| **Bond Lv.** | **Skill** | **Effect** | **SP Cost** |
|1 |Luck+2 <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/byleth/FE17_Luck_2B2_Icon.webp) | Grants LUCK+2| 100|

|9 |Sword Proficiency <br> ![pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/swordprof.png) |Proficiency with Swords. Required for Promotion/Reclassing to certain Classes |Auto |

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

While Byleth's Engage Weapons ranged from meh to incredibly, his Inheritance is useful across the board and incredibly cheap. <br><br>

<b>Divine Pulse and Mentorship</b> are the main attractions here and both are incredibly well priced for the value they bring. If you're someone who likes to be slightly over-levelled compared to the Enemy, then I recommend spreading Mentorship around. <br><br>

Byleth's Stat Skill is <b>Luck+</b> which synergizes extremely well with Divine Pulse. Even if you aren't using Divine Pulse on other Units, the boost to Luck is still useful as the higher a Unit's Luck is, the less likely they are to be hit by Enemy Critical Hits. <br><br>

Byleth's Weapon Skill is <b>Arts Focus</b> which, like other Focus Skills is borderline useless. Arts don't have much problem hitting enemies because of their high base accuracy. <br><br>

For Proficiencies, Byleth grants <b>Swords</b> which isn't anything new. However, the main prize of Byleth's Inheritance is that he grants <b>Arts Proficiency</b>. Byleth is the only Non-DLC Emblem in the entire game to grant Arts Proficiency and once you have the Ring of The Instructor, ANYONE in your army can reclass to Qi-Adept Classes.

# **Post Paralogue Gameplay (Bond 11 - 20)** 

## Stat Bonuses

| **Bond Lv.** | **MAG** | **SPD** | **LUCK** |
| 12 | +3 | +2 | +6 |
| 14 | +3 | +3 | +6 |
| 16 | +3 | +3 | +8 |
| 17 | +3 | +3 | +10 |
| 19 | +3 | +3 | +12 |

Byleth's stat bonuses cap at good but not great numbers. Luck is an exception as that +12 Luck at Bond 19 is incredible and goes a long way with Divine Pulse. 

## Sync Skills

| **Sync Skill** | **Bond Lv** | **Effect** |
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/byleth/FE17_Lost_26_Found_Icon.webp) <br> **Lost & Found** | 13 | If Unit finishes action nex to an Ally. LUCK% chance to raise Support with that Ally.  | 
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/byleth/FE17_Divine_Pulse2B_Icon.webp) <br> **Divine Pulse+** | 18 | May turn a missed Attack/Status Staff into a hit. <br> Trigger% = 50 + (1 * LUCK) |


<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

<b>Lost and Found</b> is more of a joke skill than anything serious. Having a luck-based chance of raising Support Points with allies sounds nice in theory but in practice, it's only one (1) Support Point that you can get from using a staff on an ally or fighting adjacent to them. Unlike Lost and Found, that Support Point is guaranteed instead of luck-based. <br><br> 

<b>Divine Pulse+</b> however is far from a joke. It works the exact same way as Divine Pulse but increases the activation to 50%. In practice, what this means is that if you have a character with 50 Luck (which isn't hard considering Byleth's passive Luck boost) that means they effectively have a 100% Hit Rate all the time thanks to Divine Pulse+.

</details>


## Engage Weapons 

| **Bond Lv.** | **Name** | **Might** | **Hit** | **Crit** | **Weight** | **Range** | **Effect** |
| l5 | ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/byleth/SwordoftheCreatorFE17Sprite.webp) <br> **Sword of The Creator** |  11| 90 | 10 | 7 | 1-2 |+1 Damage for every 3 Magic. Effective: Dragon. |

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

Reaching Bond 15 with Byleth grants you <b>The Sword of The Creator</b> (or Creator Sword). Despite the low Might, it is still a 1-2 Range sword that isn't too heavy and very accurate. That bonus of adding damage based on Magic might incline you to use this with Magical Units but please remember that the Creator Sword is still a Physical Weapon which calculates damage using a Unit's Strength Stat. So don't expect Magical Units to get much mileage out of this. This weapon is best on Mage Knights or Griffin Knights who have a good balance of Strength and Magic. 

</details>


## Skill Inheritance

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

When it comes to Byleth's higher Inheritance, what you're after here are the higher levels of <b>Luck+ and Divine Pulse+</b>. Divine Pulse+ is great, especially for how cheap it is. 500SP for a massive boost to your accuracy is a steal. Though you do have to grind up to Bond 18 with Byleth to get so it's a tradeoff. <b>Lost and Found</b> is better off ignored as it's a waste of SP and I've already gone into why Arts Focus is terrible. 


</details>






# **Character Builds**

<details>
<summary> WMD (Wand of Mass Destruction) </summary>

This is a popular build for Byleth and the one I almost always use. Putting Byleth on a <b>Mystical Unit</b> to take advantage of Byleth's passive boosts to Magic and the fact that he gives them Thrysus right from the start. This turns Mystical Units into magical snipers with tomes like Thunder, Elthunder, and Thoron. These tomes have shaky hit rates but you have Divine Pulse as an insurance policy. <br><br>

The downside here is that Thrysus is the only Engage Weapon Mystical Units are likely to get any real value out of. The Vajra-Mushti and Creator Sword are still physical weapons that do not synergize with the low Strength stats of Mystical Units. 

</details>

<details>
<summary> Professor Alear </summary>

<b>Alear</b> is one of the better candidates for Byleth, mainly for bonuses to Instruct and Goddess Dance they receive as a Dragon Child/Divine Dragon. Alear giving bonuses to all Stats through these two Engage Abilities pushes their Support abilities to the limit. <br><br>

Combat-wise, Alear in their default class is a decent combat unit and they will get some value out of the Engage Weapons Byleth provides them. <br><br> 

If your other Support Emblems (Micaiah, Lucina, Corrin) are already taken, then Byleth makes a pretty good partner for Alear. 

</details>

<details>
<summary> Favorite Food Goddess Dancer</summary>

Recall that one of Celica's inheritable Sync Skills at Bond 8 for 200 SP is <b>Favourite Food</b> which maxes out a Unit's Engage Meter whenever they eat a Packed Lunch.  <br><br>

This is a bit of a gimmicky joke build you could put together if you want to spam Goddess Dances. If you want to try this build, you'll get the best results from the character <b>Bunet</b>.  <br><br>

His Personal Skill (Seconds?) has a Luck% chance of triggering whenever he eats a Packed Lunch. If it does trigger, Bunet will produce another Packed Lunch. It's a good idea for Bunet to inherit a Luck+ Skill to increase the chances of Second? triggering. Again, this is a joke build meant more for memes than serious gameplay. <br><br>

</details>

# **Final Thoughts** <br>
The last of the 12 Emblems, Byleth does not disappoint. He is a Support Emblem who can switch to an effective Combat Role depending on who's wearing his Ring. His Engage Attack is arguably the best in the game, especially if you know how to take full advantage of it and even those who don't wear his Ring get some pretty good and dirt cheap Skill Inheritance from him. <br>

As I stated before, Byleth is as simple or complex as you want him to be. Whether you want him as a simple Support Refresher or another Combat Emblem, Byleth has you covered. One has to wonder though. Was Byleth holding back his true power in Three Houses by not speaking? Maybe if Byleth could speak that would have irreparably altered Fodlan forever? We may never know.
