# **Introduction**

Ike (despite his appearance and gameplay suggesting otherwise) represents the 1st half of the Tellius Duology: Path of Radiance. He is an Emblem designed to turn his wielder into a bulky Tank that not only absorbs insane amounts of damage but deals an equally insane amount of damage to his enemies in retaliation. Ike can be summed up as a "Brick Wall that hits back.".

# **Initial Gameplay (Bond 1 - 10)** 

## Stat Bonuses

| **Bond Lv.** | **HP** | **STR** | **DEF** |
| 1 | +3 | +1 | +1 |
| 2 | +3 | +1 | +2 |
| 4 | +3 | +2 | +2 |
| 7 | +5 | +2 | +2 |
| 8 | +5 | +2 | +3 |

Wearing the Ring of the Radiant Hero boosts to HP, Strength, and Defense are the least impactful parts of his kit. Yes, they synergize with his Tank play-style but the rest of his kit is where his destructive power lies elsewhere.

## Sync Skills

| **Sync Skill** | **Bond Lv** | **Effect** |
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/ike/FE17_Demolish_Icon.webp) <br> **Demolish** | 1 | Break destructible terrain in a single blow when using the "Destroy" Command. | 
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/ike/FE17_Resolve_Icon.webp) <br> **Resolve** | 1 | If unit’s HP is 75% or less after combat, grants DEF/RES+5 as long as unit’s HP stays below 75%. |
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/ike/FE17_Reposition_Icon.webp) <br> **Reposition** | 3 | Use to move an adjacent ally to the opposite side of unit using the "Reposition" Command. |

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

Like the Azure Twins, Ike has two Bond 1 Sync Skills and both are inheritable. <br><br>

<b>Demolish</b> is useful for breaking down destructible terrain as it ignores their HP. However, Demolish is a skill that mostly sees use in the Chapter you obtain Ike. Outside of that Chapter, destructible terrain is rare in Engage. <br><br>

<b>Resolve</b>, however, is much more useful. While it's nowhere near as crazy as it was in Ike's home game, that boost to Defense and Resistance synergizes well with Ike's Engage Skill. That 75% or less HP threshold is easier to hit than you'd think so don't be surprised if Resolve is constantly active. <br><br>

<b>Reposition</b> is like Roy's Advance as it's a simple but useful mobility tool. In practice, by moving an ally to the opposite side of the user, that ally has effectively moved an extra 2 spaces. <br><br>

</details>
 
## Engage Skill

| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/ike/FE17_Laguz_Friend_Icon.webp) <br> **Laguz Friend** | Unit takes 50% less damage, but sets unit’s Avo to 0. |


|**Unit Type**|**Bonus**|
|Dragon| Unit takes 60% less damage instead. |

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

Unlike other Emblems, Engaging with Ike radically changes the play style of his wearer because Laguz Friend will be active. This skill requires some context to fully understand the pros and cons. <br><br>

1) When the skill says "<b>Unit takes 1/2 Damage</b>" what it means is that the damage an enemy would inflict on you is calculated normally and THEN is cut in half. <br><br>

2) Your Avoid being set to 0 doesn't mean that you can't dodge attacks at all. What it means is that if an enemy has a Hit Rate below 100%, there is a chance (however small) that Ike's user can dodge. <br><br>

Having every attack only half as hard means Ike's Users can take on twice as many enemies as they normally would. If you have a unit with good base Defence and Resistance combined with the effects of Resolve, they could potentially stand up to both Physical and Magical enemies with an impressive amount of bulk. This is also great as you want to draw in as many enemies as possible because of Ike's Engage Attack. <br><br>

The main weakness of Laguz Friend is <b>Chain Attacks</b>. As a reminder, Chain Attacks are performed by Backup Units that deal a fixed 10% of the target's HP with an 80% accuracy. Because Chain Attacks deal a fixed amount of damage, ignoring your Defense/Resistance Stats, Laguz Friend can't do anything about that. So be careful that your Ike User is Chain Attacked to death. But fear not as there is a way to block Chain Attacks using a Sync Skill from an Emblem you get not too long after obtaining Ike. 

</details>

## Engage Attack

| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/ike/FE17_Great_Aether_Icon.webp) <br> **Great Aether**  | Use to grant DEF/RES+5, but unit can’t counter for 1 turn. Next turn, attack a 2-space area, heal HP=30% of damage dealt. Sword/axe only. |


|**Unit Type**|**Bonus**|
|Dragon| +1 Damage per hit taken |
| Armored | Extra DEF+5 (DEF+10) |
| Flying |Extra RES+5 (RES+10)|

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

The main idea behind <b>Great Aether</b> is that it turns Ike's User into a Time Bomb that detonates after 1 Turn. Therefore, the best use of Great Aether is running into a horde of enemies, digging in for the Enemy Phase, and then retaliating with extreme prejudice the following turn. You might think that not being able to counterattack enemies for 1 Turn is a pain but if use the right weapons, Great Aether's detonation on the following turn MORE than makes up for it. <br><br>

Now you may be thinking that it would be suicide to have a single unit charge head-first into enemy lines but remember, to use Great Aether, you have to be Engaged with Ike in the first place which means Laguz Friend will also be active which stacks with not only the +5 DEF and RES Great Aether grants you but also Resolve (once your HP gets low enough) and Ike's passive stat bonuses. Don't be surprised if you barely take any damage while charging up Great Aether. Besides, any damage you would take will be healed by Great Aether anyway. <br><br>

Great Aether is an Engage Attack that benefits the most from using Smash Weapons. If you want Great Aether to hit as hard as possible, use a Steel or Silver Greataxe as those weapons have an INSANE base Might of 26 and 32 respectively. If Ike's User has a high Strength Stat combined with a Greataxe, usually nothing sort of Armored Enemies are going to survive this.  <br><br>

For maximum effect, you'll want to position Ike's User in an open area to draw as many enemies as possible. Ideally, Great Aether will cover the range depicted in the diagram below. <br><br>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/ike/GreatAetherRange.PNG" alt="Description of image"> </td>
  </tr>

</table>

Even if Ike's User can't use high-power Axes normally, don't fret. Ike has them covered with his Engage Weapons. 

</details>

## Engage Weapons 

| **Bond Lv.** | **Name** | **Might** | **Hit** | **Crit** | **Weight** | **Range** | **Effect** |
| l | ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/ike/IkeHammerFE17Sprite.webp) <br> **Hammer** | 18 | 55 | 0 | 15 | 1 | Smash Weapon. Effective: Armored |
| l0 | ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/ike/UrvanFE17Sprite.webp) <br> **Urvan** | 21 | 90 | 5 | 19 | 1 | RES+3 |

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

Ike's Engage Weapons follows the theme of "<b>Really Strong but also Really Heavy</b>". Ike's Engage Weapons are some of the heaviest in the game. This means that the majority of your army will have trouble double attacking with these weapons but their Might makes up for it. <br><br>

The <b>Hammer</b> is a weapon that may seem out of place but if you're familiar with memes in the Fire Emblem Community about Ike and his infamous rival, The Black Knight, you'll know why they put this weapon on Ike. Memes aside, unlike Lyn's Killer Bow, Ike's Hammer is very different from a regular Hammer. For one, it's a Smash Weapon meaning it can't double and you attack last if you initiate combat. To make up for this, it has double the Might as a regular Hammer. <br><br>

<b>Urvan</b> at Bond 10 has the honor of being the strongest non-Smash Axe in the game. 21 Might is insane and is a good substitute for Greataxes when using Great Aether. Even if you're using it in regular combat, that accuracy means it won't have a hard time hitting foes. 19 Weight is a bit excessive but its other traits make it a fair trade-off, including the boost to Resistance to stack with Ike's other defensive bonuses.

## Skill Inheritance 

| **Bond Lv.** | **Skill** | **Effect** | **SP Cost** |
| 1| Defense+1 <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/ike/FE17_Defense_2B1_Icon.webp) | Grants DEF+1| 100|

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

Ike's inheritance is reasonably priced across the board which is fitting for someone like him. <br><br>

As I stated before, destructible terrain isn't that common in Engage so <b>Demolish</b> can be safely ignored for other skills. Just having Demolish on Ike's main user as a Sync Skill is enough. <br><br>

<b>Resolve</b> might be worth inheriting on units that see a lot of combat on the front lines. That boost to Defence and Resistance can make them surprisingly bulky, all at a reasonable SP price. <br><br>

<b>Reposition</b> is like Advance as it's an underrated mobility tool. If you can't decide what skill to put on a unit, Reposition makes a decent candidate at a reasonable SP cost. <br><br>

Ike's <b>Stat</b> and <b>Weapon Skills</b> are Defense+ and Axe Power. Axe Power is similar to Roy's Sword Power as it is really powerful but really expensive. It might be worth putting on your Axe users like Warriors, Berserkers, or Great Knights. Alternatively, if you want to amp up the damage of Great Aether, you'll want to inherit one of these skills.  <br><br>

For Weapon Proficiencies Ike provides <b>Axes and Swords</b>. These two Proficiencies together allow any unit to gain access to the Wyvern Knight Class. <br><br>

While Ike's Inheritance may seem good initially, the real prize is locked behind his Paralogue. Once you complete Ike's Paralogue, you will have access to a Sync Skill that is key to Ike's true potential as an Emblem. Fortunately for the Player, Ike's Paralogue unlocks right after the Chapter you obtain him. Be warned however that Ike's Paralogue is one of the more difficult ones in the game but still worth completing for this one Sync Skill alone. <br><br>

</details>



# **Post Paralogue Gameplay (Bond 11 - 20)** 

## Stat Bonuses

| **Bond Lv.** | **HP** | **STR** | **DEF** |
| 12 | +5 | +3 | +3 |
| 14 | +7 | +3 | +3 |
| 16 | +7 | +3 | +4 |
| 17 | +7 | +4 | +4 |
| 19 | +7 | +4 | +5 |

Ike's Stat Bonuses cap out are very impressive numbers. Those numbers go a long way in promoting Ike's playstyle as a Tank.

## Sync Skills

| **Sync Skill** | **Bond Lv** | **Effect** |
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/ike/FE17_Wrath_Icon.webp) <br> **Wrath** | 13 | At start of combat, for each HP the unit has lost, grants Crit+1 during combat. (Max +30) | 
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/ike/FE17_Resolve2B_Icon.webp) <br> **Resolve+** | 18 | If unit’s HP is 75% or less after combat, grants Def/Res+7 as long as unit’s HP stays below 75%. |

<details>
<summary> Explanation (AKA: If you only do one Emblem Paralogue, make sure it's Ike's.) </summary>

Resolve upgrades to <b>Resolve+</b>, increasing the boost to Defence and Resistance which goes a long way at making Ike's user even bulkier. <br><br>

The real prize here is <b>Wrath</b> at Bond 13. Wrath works well with Resolve as once you are in the range of this skill activating, Wrath would give you an extra boost to your Critical Rate. How it usually goes is that Ike's user will tank a hit, and Wrath boosts their Critical Rate to ensure the foe is annihilated by a Critical Hit in retaliation. <br><br>

However, where Wrath truly shines is when it's combined with Leif's Vantage. Recall in Leif's Profile, I mentioned the "<b>Vantage+Wrath Combo</b>". We'll discuss this specific build later but as a sneak peek, if Ike's user has inherited Vantage, they become one of your strongest pieces on the board. <br><br>

Wrath alone is the main reason to complete Ike's paralogue ASAP. Think of this skill as rocket fuel to turn Ike from great to amazing.

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

At Bond 15, you get Ike's iconic <b>Ragnell</b>. Like Roy's Binding Blade, Ragnell is a 1-2 Range Sword that inflicts Physical Damage despite the magical animation and grants a boost to Defence. Ragnell is Ike's answer to ranged enemies as neither the Hammer nor Urvan can attack enemies at range. Ragnell being a Physical weapon is even better as Mages have low defences, letting them be easily one-shotted.

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

Of Ike's higher Skill Inheritance, <b>Wrath</b> is your highest priority. I recommend inheriting Wrath on Leif's Main User as they will naturally have Vantage as a Sync Skill from wearing Leif's Ring. 2000 SP is a lot to ask for this skill but it could be worth it. 

</details>






# **Character Builds**

There are 2 Builds I usually run with Ike, both of which are fun to mess around with.


<details>
<summary> Vantage+Wrath Combo </summary>

This is the bread and butter build for Ike as it is quite easy to assemble. What you need is the following. <br><br>

1) A Unit with a high Strength Stat and/or Growth Rate such as Louis, Amber, Panette, etc. Reclass them to an Axe-wielding Class like Warrior or Berserker. <br><br>

2) The Unit selected in Step 1 has inherited Vantage from Leif. Louis and Amber are especially good candidates for this as by the time you have Leif to get Vantage, both of them have already joined your army. <br><br>

3) A Killer Axe with an Engraving from either Lyn (-3 Might, +20 Critical) or Corrin (-2 Might, +30 Critical). <br><br>

4) Completed Ike's Paralogue to unlock his higher Bond Levels and Wrath. <br><br>

A normal Killer Axe has a Critical Rate of 30. Lyn's and Corrin's Engraving at the Forge gives a further boost of 20 or 30 Critical respectively. Wrath gives a Critical Boost of 1-30 depending on the user's current HP. With all of these components in place, Ike's User can reach critical rates of 50% and above. This is before you take into consideration other factors such as the Unit's Dexterity Stat which boosts Critical Rate. <br><br>

With this build, Ike's User tanking hits will let them activate Wrath to make their Critical Rate skyrocket and once they are past a certain HP threshold, Resolve with activate. At this point, Ike's User can shrug off enemy attacks and obliterate the foe with a Wrath-fueled Critical Hit. <br><br>

Even if your HP gets low, Vantage will activate as an insurance policy, making you attack first and likely Critical the enemy, killing them. Remember that regular Vantage requires you to be 25% HP or less to activate. At that point, you are most likely receiving the maximum Critical Boost from Wrath (+30 Critical) so don't be surprised if you have a Critical Rate somewhere in the 80s or 90s. <br><br>

I cannot stress how powerful this build is. It has to be seen to be believed. Vantage+Wrath is one of the most powerful builds in Engage and is easy to set up if you plan for it in advance. If you're playing on Maddening Difficult, do not hesitate to use this build as it will save you a lot of headache and frustration. However, please remember that this build is not invincible. Its biggest weakness is that you can't counter ranged enemies with a Killer Axe. 

</details>

<details>
<summary> Invincible Tank </summary>

This build revolves around maximizing Ike's bulk and tankiness. I recommend putting Ike on a <b>General</b> or <b>Great Knight</b> (who can use Axes). These classes have great Strength stats which combined with the high might of Ike's Engage Weapons, leads to more consistent 1-Hit Kills and stronger Great Aethers. Furthermore, these classes don't care about their Speed stat or dodging so the Avoid penalty of Laguz Friend is negligible to them. The main weakness with this build is Mages as Generals and to a lesser extent, Great Knights have bad Resistance Stats which makes them susceptible to magic. You also need to worry about Chain Attacks as the enemy loves to sprinkle Backup Units among their ranks. However, this weakness can be patched up with a certain Sync Skill from another Emblem.


</details>



# **Final Thoughts** <br>

Out of all the Emblems in the game, Ike benefits the most from completing his Paralogue as soon as it unlocks. Doing so takes him from a great Emblem to a fantastic Emblem. He can turn anyone into a nigh invincible tank of destruction with his kit but his main weakness is still Chain Attacks which can be a pain. If you want to push Ike to his limits with the Vantage+Wrath Combo, it is definitely a good idea to pick out your Main Ike User well in advance and have them inherit Vantage from Leif in preparation for Ike. Do this and watch enemies melt before anyone foolish enough to attack Ike's Main User.
