# **Introduction**
Tiki is one of the most unique Emblems in the game as like Ike, her Engage Form radically changes the playstyle of her wearer. Whereas Ike turns his wearer into a Tank, Tiki turns her wearer into a Dragon, literally. Though Tiki won't give you a British Accent which is a shame. 


# Stat Bonuses

| **Bond Lv.** | **HP** | **DEF** | **LUCK** |
| 1 | +5 | +1 | +2 |
| 2 | +5 | +1 | +4 |
| 4 | +5 | +2 | +4 |
| 7 | +7 | +2 | +4 |
| 9 | +7 | +2 | +6 |
| 12 | +7 | +3 | +6 |
| 13 | +10 | +3 | +6 |
| 15 | +10 | +3 | +8 |
| 17 | +10 | +4 | +8 |
| 18 | +10 | +4 | +10 |

Wearing the Bracelet of the Ancestor grants boosts to HP, Defence, and Luck. These are all stats that make her bearer more durable and resistant to enemy criticals, especially when combined with one of her Sync Skills. 

# Sync Skills

| **Sync Skill** | **Bond Lv** | **Effect** |
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/tiki/FE17_Starsphere_Icon.webp) <br> **Starsphere** | 1 |Grants +15% to all Unit's Growth Rates  |

<summary> Explanation </summary>

<b>Starsphere</b> is Tiki's most useful Sync Skill on both herself and when inherited. That increase in Growth Rates includes Build which is incredibly significant as raising Build in Engage without help from Leif is difficult. For reference, the average Growth Rate for Build in Engage is 10%, so having Starsphere turns that into 25% which means every 1 in 4 Level Ups has a chance of increasing Build. <br><br>

That's not all as Starsphere also makes a Unit's good Growth Rates even better. For exampple, let's take a character like Amber who has a personal Strength Growth Rate of 45%. With Starsphere, that's bumped to 60% and this is before we factor in Class Growth Rate Modifiers like Warrior which gives an additional 20% for a total 80% Growth Rate to Strength. If you decide to get Tiki in the Early Game, you can spread around Starsphere to your Early Game units to increase their growth.  <br><br>

<b>Geosphere</b> and its upgraded version are useful as that +3/+5 to Defence and Resistance can give some decent bulk to both Tiki's wearer and adjacent allies.  <br><br>

<b>Lifesphere</b> and its upgraded versions can be good for topping the HP of Tiki's wearer. However, the real purpose of this skill is curing status which includes Poison and Break which can be just as deadly to you as it is to the enemy. The main downside is that it requires you to use "Wait" which means not attacking or using items. <br><br>

<b>Lightsphere</b> is a bit situational. Yes, it stacks well with Tiki's passive boosts to Luck, but oftentimes in Engage, enemies will have low Critical rates (10% and below) so turning an 8% chance for a critical hit into a 4% chance isn't that great. However, it can be useful on characters with low Luck who enjoy attacking on the Player Phase. <br>
<b>Fun Fact</b>: In the original Mystery of the Emblem the Lightsphere not only completely negated enemy criticals but also effectiveness and terrain bonuses from the enemy. Talk about a downgrade.

# Engage Skill

| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/tiki/FE17_Draconic_Form_Icon.webp) <br> **Draconic Form** | When Engaged with Tiki, grants Max HP+10, Build+5, and all Basic Stats+5. <br> Unit can only use Tiki's Engage Weapons while Engaged. |


|**Unit Type**|**Bonus**|
|Armored|Negates Terrain Damage. |
|Mystical|Extra RES+5 |

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

<b>Draconic Form</b> is Tiki's other claim to fame and is what makes her unique among all the Emblems, including the DLC ones. When you Engage with Tiki, you become a Dragon. Yes, you read that right. Tiki's Engage Form is literally a Dragon. <br><br>

Tiki's Engage Form has both its pros and cons. While Engaged, you gain <b>Max HP+10, Build+5, and +5 to all seven of your basic stats</b>. Armored Units get the added benefit of negating Terrain damage from things like Flames while Mystical Units get an extra +5 Res. The base effect alone makes Tiki's wearer incredibly bulky. Please remember that while Draconic Form is active, you are treated as both a Dragon and Flying Unit meaning you need to be careful around Dragon-slaying weapons like the Wyrmslayer and Bows. <br><br> 

The main downside with Tiki's Engage is that since you're now a Dragon without opposable thumbs, you cannot use your standard weapons. This means that while Engaged with Tiki, you are forced to use her Engage Weapons.

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

Tiki's Engage Weapons function similarly to Byleth's. Everyone has access to Eternal Claw and Tail Smash. <br><br>

<b>Eternal Claw</b> is my go-to for Tiki's Engage Weapons. It's a Killer weapon with good Might and Accuracy. With the passive Build and Speed boost from Draconic Form, you can expect to be doubling with this weapon.<br><br>

I'm not too fond of Smash Weapons in Engage unless I'm using them for Engage Attacks but <b>Tail Smash</b> is one of the few exceptions. Despite forcing you to attack second when initiating combat, Tiki's passive boost to HP and Defence/Resistance means that you can shrug off the attack before slamming the enemy with your tail in retaliation. However, we aren't done as what Dragon would be complete without some kind of Breath attack? <br><br>

What kind of Breath you have depends on your class type and all of them are references to the different Dragon Forms Tiki could assume in the original Mystery of the Emblem. Before I got over the different types of Breath, you should know that they all share the following traits. <br><br>

1) They are Smash Weapons without the ability to push enemies. What this means is that you strike last, even if you initiate combat and you cannot double attack with them. <br>

2) They half the foe's Defence/Resistance depending on the Breath. <br>

3) They are all AoE style attacks meaning you can hit and potentially kill multiple enemies in a single move. <br><br>
 

<b>Dragons</b> get the <b>Fog Breath</b> of Divine Dragons which are effective against Dragons like Wyvern Knights and non-Corrupted Dragons. It also creates Fog Terrain. <br><br>

<b>Armored Units</b> get the <b>Ice Breath</b> of Ice Dragons which freezes the foes, preventing them from moving the following turn. <br><br>

<b>Flying Units</b> channel the annoyance of Mystery of the Emblem's Wyverns with their <b>Flame Breath</b> that sets the area on fire. Interestingly, the AoE effect hits a much wider area but at a reduced 70% damage. <br><br>

<b>Mystical Units</b>, of course, get the <b>Dark Breath</b> of Mage Dragons which is a magic attack that calculates damage using your Magic Stat. <br><br>

Every other unit type in the game (<b>Backup, Cavalry, Covert, and Qi Adept</b>) gets the <b>Fire Breath</b> of generic Fire Dragons. <br><br> 

Despite this, Tiki's Engage Weapons pale in comparison to her Engage Attack.

# Engage Attack

| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/tiki/FE17_Divine_Blessing_Icon.webp) <br> **Divine Blessing**  | Use to grant 1 ally a Revival Stone. |
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/tiki/FE17_Divine_Blessing_Icon.webp) <br> **Divine Blessing+**  | <b>If Marth is Adjacent</b>. <br> Use to grant 1 ally a Revival Stone and another effect depending on whether ally is synced with an Emblem. <br> If Ally is not Synced: <b>Fully restores HP</b>. <br><br> If Ally is synched: <b>+3 to Engage Meter</b>. <br><br> If Ally is Engaged: <b>Restores Engage Turns</b>. |


|**Unit Type**|**Bonus**|
|Dragon|Restores 20 HP to Ally. |
|Qi Adept |Heals target Ally's Status Effects. |

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

Tiki's <b>Divine Blessing</b> is like Byleth's Goddess Dance in that, it isn't an attack but a support ability. That Revival Stone granted by this Engage Attack functions exactly the same as the Revival Stones on Enemy Bosses. If an ally has their HP reduced to zero, they don't die, they just lose their Revival Stone. The upside is that your unit doesn't die but the downside is that if an enemy breaks your Revival Stone, it immediately ends the battle, meaning you can't counterattack. You can think of this as putting an extra life on one of your characters or effectively doubling their HP. Lastly, this Revival Stone persists, even after Tiki's Engage runs out, so you could have multiple allies with Revival Stone Insurance Policies. <br><br>

However, since Tiki is a DLC Emblem, her Engage Attack has an upgraded version. <b>Divine Blessing+</b> requires an ally wearing Marth's Ring to be adjacent to Tiki's wearer. If you do, then not only does Divine Blessing+ grant a Revival Stone but it gains an additional effect depending on whether or not the target has an Emblem Ring equipped. <br><br>

I cannot emphasize how powerful Tiki's ability to replenish Engage Meters and prolong Engage Forms is. There are so many possibilities like replenishing the Engage Meter of your Byleth of Micaiah User for another round of Goddess Dance or Augmented!Warp. You could prolong powerful Engage Forms like Roy, Ike, or Eirika. This is especially good for the Emblem of Rivals as their Combat Arts cost Engage Turns to use, meaning that with Divine Blessing+, you can get another use of Raging Storm. <br><br>

Lastly, if you use Divine Blessing+ on someone Engaged with the 13th Emblem, BOTH members of the Engage Duo will have their Engage Turns refilled.

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>
When it comes to Tiki's Skill Inheritance, the main prizes here are the Sphere Skills, especially <b>Starsphere</b>. To get the most mileage out of this, you should get this skill as soon as possible. If you're planning on using Vander for your playthrough, I highly recommend putting Starsphere on him to patch up his shaky Growth Rates. <br><br>

The other Sphere Skill I recommend inheriting is <b>Lifesphere</b>, not for the HP recovery but primarily for the free status curing. <br><br>

Tiki's Stat Skill is <b>HP/Luck+</b> which makes you bulkier and more resistant to enemy critical hits. They are decently priced so they could be a worthwhile investment. The interesting thing about Tiki's HP/Luck+ skills is that they stack with HP+ and Luck+ from Corrin and Byleth. So if you want to give a unit some serious bulk or extra protection against enemy critical hits, consider stacking these skills.<br><br>

Tiki's Guard Skill is <b>Special Guard</b> which sounds odd but in practice, it affects Breath weapons from enemy Dragons like Corrupted Wyrms. In short, any weapon that isn't covered by another specific weapon type falls under the "Special" Category.<br><br>

Lastly, Tiki has the distinction of being the only Emblem in the game other than Byleth who can grant <b>Arts Proficiency</b> which is her only Proficiency.

# **Character Builds**

<details>
<summary> Alear finally becomes a Dragon. </summary>

This build is mainly for jokes as Alear themself cannot become a Dragon in normal gameplay but with Tiki's help, the Divine Dragon can make that dream a reality.<br><br>

In all seriousness though, Alear is not a bad choice for Tiki. Yes, Alear leans more towards Support than Combat, but the extra stats and bulk granted by Draconic Form can turn Alear from an OK Combat Unit into a powerhouse. The Fog Breath granted by Tiki can be useful for taking down bulky Wyvern Knights if none of your Bow-users can do the job. <br><br>

However, keep in mind that Tiki being on Alear has some anti-synergy with the 13th Emblem as they cannot receive the effects of Divine Blessing+ if Tiki is synced with Alear. 


</details>

<details>
<summary> Tiki, Breaker of Worlds </summary>
Draconic Form gives a noticeable boost in power to Tiki's wearer when Engaged. Your first thought might be putting Tiki on one of your weaker units to give them a leg up. However, what if you put Tiki's Bracelet on an already strong Combat Unit? If you have a unit that is consistently killing enemies, then Tiki can make them an even bigger powerhouse to tear through the battlefield. 

</details>

<details>
<summary> Tiki's Favorite Food </summary>
This build is similar to the one I outlined in Byleth's profile. Inheriting Favorite Food from Celica, allows Tiki's wearer to quickly refill their Engage Meter for another round of Draconic Form. Not only would you regain Tiki's powerful Dragon form, but also have another dose of Divine Blessing ready to go as an insurance policy for another member of your army. 

</details>

# **Final Thoughts** <br>
Overall, for the 1st DLC Emblem you have to work for, Tiki is certainly worth the trouble of completing her Divine Paralogue. She can turn anyone into a powerful, albeit melee-locked Combat Unit through her Dragon Form, provide great support abilities through her Sphere Skills, and provide a great safety net for your units through her Engage Attack. If you're going to use Tiki, I highly recommend also deploying a unit equipped with Marth's Ring as Divine Blessing+ is too good to pass up. Tiki really enjoys being around Mar-Mar after all.
