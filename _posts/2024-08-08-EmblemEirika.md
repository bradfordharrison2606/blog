# **Introduction**

Eirika (& Ephraim) represents the 3rd Game of the GBA Fire Emblems: Sacred Stones. They are an Emblem that is actually two Emblems in one, each of the Azure Twins offering different perks and abilities to their bearer. While they might seem complicated on paper, in practice they are very similar to Roy in being generalist Emblems designed to make anyone a better combat unit overall. However, Eirika (& Ephraim) have the added bonus of being excellent at exterminating Corrupted foes.  

# **Initial Gameplay (Bond 1 - 10)** 

## Stat Bonuses

| **Bond Lv.** | **MAG** | **DEX** | **LUCK** |
| 1 | +1 | +1 | +2 |
| 2 | +1 | +1 | +4 |
| 4 | +1 | +2 | +4 |
| 7 | +2 | +2 | +4 |
| 8 | +2 | +2 | +6 |

Wearing the Ring of The Azure Twins boosts Magic, Dexterity, and Luck. That boost to Magic may seem out of place but as you'll see, it synergizes with Eirika and Ephraim's gameplay a bit.  

## Sync Skills

| **Sync Skill** | **Bond Lv** | **Effect** |
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/eirika/FE17_Night_and_Day_Icon.webp) <br>Night & Day | 1 | Use to switch Emblems and swap between Lunar Brace/Gentility and Solar Brace/Bravery for all allies.  | 
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/eirika/FE17_Lunar_Brace_Icon.webp) <br> **Lunar Brace**| 1 | If unit initiates combat with a physical attack, deals extra damage=20% of foe’s Def. <br> (**Only Usable w/Eirika**)  |

| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/eirika/FE17_Gentility_Icon.webp) <br> **Gentility** | 3 | Unit takes 3 less damage. <br> (**Only Usable w/Eirika**)  |
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/eirika/FE17_Bravery_Icon.webp) <br> **Bravery** | 3 | Unit deals +3 damage. <br> (**Only Usable w/Ephraim**)|

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

Eirika and Ephraim are unique in that they essentially have 5 Sync Skills but you can only use 3 of them at any given time. Night and Day swaps whichever Twin is in the lead and unlike other Skills like this, Night and Day DOES NOT consume a turn. <br><br>

Eirika grants <b>Lunar Brace and Gentility</b> which makes her wearer hit harder and take less damage. That extra damage from Lunar Brace might sound low in theory but in practice, by the time you have access to this Sync Skill, most enemies will have enough DEF that the extra damage is very much worth it. <br><br>

Ephraim however grants <b>Solar Brace and Bravery</b> to his wearer. Solar Brace is especially useful as the HP you recover is based on the damage you deal to the enemy, meaning Glass Cannon characters get especially good mileage out of this as it lets them recover the HP they would have lost after taking a hit. Bravery adding a flat damage bonus is just icing on the cake. Ephraim is great for low Defense enemies like Magic Users as Lunar Brace won't add that much damage. <br><br> 

While this might seem complicated, a good rule of thumb is that Eirika works better with Physical Units while Ephraim is more suited to Magical Units. Lunar Brace only activates with physical weapons and Gentility will cushion the blow from any counterattacks from the enemy. Meanwhile, Bravery can act a lot of Celica's Resonance in that extra 3 Damage can be enough to secure a 1-Round Kill, and Solar Brace can keep your Mages topped off on HP. You want to use Eirika and Ephraim on units that can reliably double enemies to maximize the effects of their Sync Skills. <br><br>

However, we have to discuss another mechanic of Eirika and Ephraim's Sync Skills. Night and Day does not only affect their wearer. It also affects ANYONE who has inherited Lunar/Solar Brace and Gentility/Bravery. Here is an example to show what I mean. <br><br>

Imagine that you have 3 Units. Unit A is Eirika's Main User. Unit B has inherited Lunar Brace, and Unit C has inherited Gentility. When Unit A uses Night and Day to switch to Ephraim (Solar Brace and Bravery) Unit B and C will switch to Solar Brace and Bravery respectively as well. The same happens if you use Night and Day again to switch back to Eirika on a subsequent turn. <br><br>

What this means is that anyone who has inherited these Sync Skills is at the mercy of Eirika and Ephraim's wearer. So if you're planning on spreading around their Sync Skills, do be mindful of that as some units benefit from one Twin's Sync Skills but not the other's. Lastly, if you enter a battle and do not deploy someone with the Ring of the Azure Twins, anyone who has inherited their Sync Skills will default to Eirika's Skills (Lunar Brace & Gentility). <br><br>

But, if all this is too complicated or you don't want to constantly switch between both Twins, then why not both? This is where we come to Eirika and Ephraim's Engage Skill. <br><br>

## Engage Skill

| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/eirika/FE17_Sacred_Twins_Icon.webp) <br> **Sacred Twins** | While engaged with Eirika & Ephraim, changes Lunar/Solar Brace to Eclipse Brace and Gentility/Bravery to Blue Skies for all allies.|

| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/eirika/FE17_Eclipse_Brace_Icon.webp) <br> **Eclipse Brace** | If unit initiates combat, unit deals extra damage=20% of foe’s Def with physical attacks and recovers HP=30% of damage dealt|
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/eirika/FE17_Blue_Skies_Icon.webp) <br> **Blue Skies** | Unit takes 3 less damage and deals +3 damage.|


<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

Eirika and Ephraim's Engage Skill <b>Sacred Twins</b> is quite unique among Engage Skills in that it doesn't grant any additional effects. It acts as if both Eirika and Ephraim are in the lead by merging their Sync Skills into <b>Eclipse Brace and Blue Skies</b>. <br><br>

Eclipse Brace gives you the damage boost of Lunar Brace (assuming you're using a Physical Weapon) which increases the HP you recover from Solar Brace. <br><br>

Blue Skies is far simpler but incredibly practical for as long as it's active, you will ALWAYS inflict more damage and take less damage, regardless of what weapon you're using. <br><br>

It is no exaggeration that Eirika and Ephraim's Engage Form is one of the stronger ones in the game as it turns almost anyone into a powerhouse. One more thing is that while Engaged, anyone else who has inherited Eirika and Ephraim's Sync Skills will also have access to Eclipse Brace and/or Blue Skies. <br><br>

But the fun doesn't stop there as the Twin's Engage Attack keeps the powerhouse train going. <br><br>

</details>

## Engage Attack

| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/eirika/FE17_Twin_Strike_Icon.webp) <br> **Twin Strike** | Use to make a sword attack followed by a lance attack from Ephraim on adjacent foe. Effective: Corrupted.  |


|**Unit Type**|**Bonus**|
|Dragon| +20% Damage |
|Cavalry | Ephraim deals +50% damage |

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

Twin Strike is designed to annihilate Corrupted Foes. I bring this up as by the time you have access to the Ring of the Azure Twins, the Main Story Chapters are going to be infested with Corrupted. The base effect might seem lackluster as you're just doing two basic attacks. Remember that Twin Strike will <b>ALWAYS</b> be boosted by the effects of Eclipse Brace and Blue Skies. These effects apply to BOTH hits of Twin Strike which causes its damage to skyrocket to nuke status. <br><br>

The Class Bonuses are all about dealing more damage. Dragons boost the damage by both his of Twin Strike while Cavalry get a ludicrous bonus to the damage Ephraim deals. 50% Extra Damage is overkill which is never a bad thing in Fire Emblem. Like other Engage Attacks, if you want the most mileage out of Twin Strike, use a Smash Weapon like a Steel or Silver Blade. <br><br>

I recommend saving Twin Strike for Corrupted Wyrm enemies as they are incredibly difficult to kill without Effectiveness damage. Even without an Anti-Corrupted weapon of your own (yet), Ephraim's Siegmund (discussed later) will more than pick up the slack. Or you could use Twin Strike to break a Boss's Revival Stone, especially if it's boosted by the Cavalry bonus. <br><br>

## Engage Weapons 

| **Bond Lv.** | **Name** | **Might** | **Hit** | **Crit** | **Weight** | **Range** | **Effect** |
| l | ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/eirika/EirikaRapierFE17Sprite.webp) <br> **Rapier** | 7 | 95 | 10 | 5 | 1 |Effective: Armored, Cavalry. |
| l0 | ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/eirika/WindSwordFE17Sprite.webp) <br> **Wind Sword** | 10 | 70 | 0 | 9 | 1-2 |Magic Weapon. Effective: Flying |
| - | **Siegmund** | 14 | 80 | 0 | 11 | 1 |Used only during Engage Attack. Effective: Corrupted. |

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

Unlike everything else in their kit, the usable Engage Weapons exclusively come from Eirika. <br><br>

Eirika's <b>Rapier</b> has nearly identical stats to Marth's Rapier but lacks the +20 Avoid and is slightly heavier. It does have a 10% Critical Rate but that's hardly a fair trade-off. <br><br>

The <b>Wind Sword</b> is another example of good magic Weapons in Engage. Unlike the Levin Sword or Leif's Light Brand, the Wind Sword is effective against Fliers. While this won't amount to much against Griffin Knights due to their high Resistance Stats, this can score you some kills against Wyvern Knights who usually have low Resistance Stats. <br><br>

<b>Siegmund</b> is Ephraim's Engage Weapon and it functions similarly to Leif's Master Bow in that it is always used for Twin Strike. However, unlike the Master Bow, Siegmund has great stats and Corrupted Effectiveness which is the main reason why Twin Strike is essentially a "Corrupted Wyrm Extermination" Button. <br><br>

## Skill Inheritance 

| **Bond Lv.** | **Skill** | **Effect** | **SP Cost** |
| 1| Lunar/Solar Brace <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/eirika/FE17_Lunar_Brace_Icon.webp)  ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/eirika/FE17_Solar_Brace_Icon.webp)  |If unit initiates combat with a physical attack, deals extra damage=20% of foe’s Def. <br> If unit initiates combat, unit recovers HP=30% of damage dealt. | 3000 |

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

Eirika and Ephraim's Skill Inheritance leans more towards the expensive side because they lean more towards the powerful side of Inheritable Skills, though not to the same degree as Roy. <br><br>

The <b>Brace Skills</b> and <b>Gentility/Bravery</b> are the main prizes here. Inheriting either Lunar Brace or Gentility gives you BOTH versions of the skill. Since each skill is two skills in one, they are expectedly, very expensive. You aren't inheriting these without liberal use of Skill Books and the Ancient Well. However, if you do plan to inherit them, be warned that you will need to be mindful of the Night and Day mechanic I discussed previously. It may be a good idea to inherit them on units who benefit from both versions of the Skill. <br><br>

The Twins' Stat Skill is <b>Dodge+</b> (Critical Avoid). These skills might seem like a waste, especially for their SP cost but in Engage, there are multiple units with lackluster Luck stats which leaves them more susceptible to enemy Criticals. So it's better safe than sorry. <br><br> 

Their Weapon Skill is <b>Lance Agility</b> which like the other Agility Skills I'm not too fond of. However, it can see some niche use on Lance Dodge Tanks like Fliers. <br><br>

Lastly, Eirika and Ephraim provide <b>Sword and Lance Proficiency</b> respectively. Not to go into spoilers but Lance Proficiency might be especially welcome by the time you obtain the Ring of the Azure Twins.

# **Post Paralogue Gameplay (Bond 11 - 20)** 

## Stat Bonuses

| **Bond Lv.** | **MAG** | **DEX** | **LUCK** |
| 12 | +2 | +3 | +6 |
| 14 | +3 | +3 | +6 |
| 16 | +3 | +3 | +8 |
| 17 | +3 | +4 | +8 |
| 19 | +3 | +4 | +10 |

That boost to Luck could be useful when combined with an inherited Avoid+ skill. This could effectively render Eirika and Ephraim's wearer immune to Criticals.  

## Sync Skills

| **Sync Skill** | **Bond Lv** | **Effect** |
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/eirika/FE17_Lunar_Brace2B_Icon.webp) <br> **Lunar Brace+**| 13 | If unit initiates combat with a physical attack, deals extra damage=30% of foe’s Def. <br> (**Only Usable w/Eirika**)  |

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

As you'd expect by now, the latter half of the Twins' Bond Levels yield upgrades to their primary Sync Skills. As discussed earlier, the Twins' Sync Skills are simple but practical and their + versions build on this trend by increasing the magnitude of their base effects. However, the true beauty of upgrading these skills is their effect on their Sacred Twins Engage Skill.

</details>

## Engage Skill

| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/eirika/FE17_Sacred_Twins_Icon.webp) <br> **Sacred Twins+** | While engaged with Eirika & Ephraim, changes Lunar/Solar Brace+ to Eclipse Brace+ and Gentility+/Bravery+ to Blue Skies+ for all allies.|

| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/eirika/FE17_Eclipse_Brace2B_Icon.webp) <br> **Eclipse Brace+** | If unit initiates combat, unit deals extra damage=30% of foe’s Def with physical attacks and recovers HP=50% of damage dealt|
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/eirika/FE17_Blue_Skies2B_Icon.webp) <br> **Blue Skies+** | Unit takes 5 less damage and deals +5 damage.|


<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

Unlike other Emblems, Eirika and Ephraim are an example of their Engage Skill getting stronger the higher their Bond Level is. The game doesn't reflect this but I like to refer to their upgraded Engage Skill as <b>Sacred Twins+</b>. <br><br>

What this means is that Eclipse Brace and Blue Skies also get upgraded to their + versions to combine the + versions of their base skills, meaning this powerhouse of an Engage Form can become even more of a powerhouse. <br><br>

However, please remember that Sacred Twins+ only gives you the Eclipse Brace+ and Blue Skies+ if you've unlocked Lunar/Solar Brace+ and Gentility/Bravery+ respectively. <br><br>

What this means is that say, for example, you're at Bond 16 with Eirika and Ephraim and activate their Engage. Sacred Twins+ will grant you Eclipse Brace+ but also only grant you regular Blue Skies. This is because you unlock Gentility+/Bravery+ at Bond 18 which is required for Blue Skies+. This also applies to other units that have inherited the Brace Skills and Gentility/Bravery. If they only have the base versions and not the + versions, Sacred Twins+ will only turn them into Eclipse Brace and Blue Skies. <br><br>

In short, Bond 18 is where you get the most mileage out of Sacred Twins+.

## Engage Weapons 

| **Bond Lv.** | **Name** | **Might** | **Hit** | **Crit** | **Weight** | **Range** | **Effect** |
| l5 | ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/eirika/SieglindeFE17Sprite.webp) <br> **Sieglinde** | 12 | 90 | 0 | 9 | 1 |Effective: Corrupted |

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

At Bond 15, you gain access to Eirika's signature weapon. Her Sacred Twin Weapon <b>Sieglinde</b>. Now its stats may seem low compared to the likes of Mulagir, The Binding Blade, and Tyrfing, but where Sieglinde truly shines is its Corrupted Effectiveness. Remember how I said that by the time you get the Ring of the Azure Twins, Corrupted Enemies were going to be more common? Well by the time you have access to Sieglinde via completing Eirika's Paralogue, Main Story Chapters for the rest of the game are absolutely infested with Corrupted. This means at Bond 15, this weapon has triple might (36) against 99% of the generic enemies on any given map. <br><br>

Furthermore, remember how I said Twin Strike is great for deleting Corrupted Wyrms? Use Sieglinde for that attack and you are almost guaranteed to kill them because both Sieglinde and Siegmund have Corrupted Effectiveness.

## Skill Inheritance

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

You know the drill by now, the latter half of an Emblem's Inheritance gives you access to higher versions of the skills offered in their first 10 Bond Levels. The Brace+ Skills and Gentility/Bravery+ are especially expensive to inherit but again they can be absolute game changers for a unit's power level. If you're willing to go the distance with grinding Skill Books and keep the whole "Night and Day" effect in mind, then go right ahead.

# **Character Builds**
I compared the Azure Twins to Roy as they are both generalist Emblems that don't require specific builds. Eirika works well on a wide variety of units due to their Engage Form and Sacred Twins giving their wearer a large boost to their power. I most find myself using Eirika and Ephraim on Physical Units, particularly the following.



<details>
<summary> Cavalry Build </summary>

These builds leverage the +50% Damage Bonus Cavalry Units get from Ephraim's half of Twin Strike to turn this already powerful Engage Attack into a Nuke. Cavarly Units like Paladin, Great Knights, Mage Knights and Wolf Knights. Wolf Knight's especially benefit as they have high Speed Stats which allow them reliably double enemies and get increased mileage out of the Azure Twins' Sync Skills. If you go this route, be ensure that your Cavalry Unit can use Swords to maximize the damage from your half of Twin Strike as Steel and Silver Blades have higher might than Sieglinde when attacking non-Corrupted enemies. 

</details>


<details>
<summary> Qi Adept Build </summary>

While Qi Adept Classes don't get any bonuses from Twin Strike, they still make great partners for the Azure Twins. Recall how I said that to get the most mileage out the Azure Twins' Sync Skills, it's best to use them on units who can easily double attack enemies. Qi Adepts use Body Arts as their primary offensive weapon and Arts Weapons have a Brave Effect when initiating combat (They strike twice). Martial Masters have decent Speed Stats, meaning they will strike 4 times if they initate combat and all 4 of those hits will be boosted by the Brace Skills and Gentility/Bravery/Blue Skies. Martial Masters are mainly a Support Class but the Azure Twins can turn them into offensive powerhouses. 

</details>


# **Final Thoughts** <br>

Despite their complexity of being two Emblems for the price of one, Eirika and Ephraim can be boiled down to "Do more Damage. Take less Damage" and this mentality will get you pretty far with them. If you're in a battle and there is one foe that makes you think "Ok this guy has to die right now" sic Eirika and Ephraim on them and watch them vanish.
