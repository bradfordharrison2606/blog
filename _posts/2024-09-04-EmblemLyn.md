# **Introduction**
Lyn represents the 2nd of the GBA Fire Emblem Games: Blazing Sword. She is widely considered one of the best Combat-focused Emblems in the game. Lyn's play style is focused on 2 things: Archery and boosting the Speed (SPD) of her wearer to ludricrous levels. 

# **Initial Gameplay (Bond 1 - 10)** 

## Stat Bonuses

| **Bond Lv.** | **DEX** | **SPD** | **RES** |
| 1 | +1 | +1 | +1 |
| 2 | +1 | +2 | +1 |
| 4 | +2 | +2 | +1 |
| 7 | +2 | +2 | +2 |
| 9 | +2 | +3 | +2 |

Wearing Lyn's Rings grants boosts to Dexterity, Speed, and Resistance. Speed is the biggest perk here as it's the one stat all combat units appreciate as it makes it easier to double attack opponents. 

## Sync Skills

| **Sync Skill** | **Bond Lv** | **Effect** |

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

Lyn only has 2 Sync Skills like Roy. However, just like Roy, her Sync Skills are so good that giving her a 3rd one would risk making her overpowered. <br><br>

<b>Alacrity</b> is Lyn's primary Sync Skill and is the lynchpin of her entire kit. In Fire Emblem Games, during combat, if a unit's Speed exceeds that of the enemy's Speed by at least 5, they perform an additional attack. This applies to both you and the enemy. The usual way this works is that if you are doubling the enemy, the flow of combat is:<br><br>

<b>Your 1st Attack -> Enemy Counterattack -> Your 2nd Attack.</b> <br><br>

Alacrity however changes up this order letting you get in both of your attacks BEFORE the enemy can counterattack. <br><br>

<b>Your 1st Attack -> Your 2nd Attack -> Enemy Counterattack.</b> <br><br>

This essentially gives Lyn's users the Brave Effect of allowing them to attack twice in a row and it stacks with actual Brave Weapons allowing you to get FOUR (4) attacks before the enemy can counter. Alacrity lets you take out dangerous enemies before they have a chance to hurt you. Engage has a lot of characters who qualify as "Glass Cannons" because they hit hard but have the defenses of wet tissue paper. Alacrity helps fix this weakness as the enemy can't hurt you if they're already dead. That 9 Speed threshold might look intimidating but Lyn's other tools make that threshold almost laughably easy to hit. However, please remember that Alacrity will not trigger if you using weapons that cannot double attack like Smash Weapons or the Thunder-line of Tomes. <br><br>

Lyn's 2nd Sync Skill is <b>Speedtaker</b> which lets you "steal" Speed from defeated foes. This skill makes Lyn's wearer snowball like crazy because it feeds directly into Alacrity. Get a few kills with Speedtaker equipped and that 9 Speed threshold for Alacrity is incredibly easy to activate. Alacrity makes it easier to kill opponents which activates Speedtaker for even more Speed. Wash, Rinse, and Repeat until you have a lightning-fast specter of death roaming the battlefield.

## Engage Skill

| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/lyn/FE17_Call_Doubles_Icon.webp) <br> **Call Doubles** | Creates four illusory doubles that can make chain attacks with unit. <br> Doubles have 1HP, a Mani Katti and identical stats as Unit. Disappear when Engage ends.|


|**Unit Type**|**Bonus**|
|Dragon| +1 Double Created (5 Total) |
|Flying| Doubles have +10 Avoid |

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

Call Doubles might seem lacklustre compared to other Engage Skills but it has its uses. The primary one is Enemy AI Manipulation. For the uninformed, the Enemy AI in Fire Emblem Games loves to kill things. So when it sees a 1 HP Phantom, it starts salivating as it is something it is almost guaranteed to kill and thus will prioritize the Phantom over your units. I am not exaggerating when I say this can SAVE LIVES if used correctly. If you have an ally that you believe the enemy will target and kill, have Lyn call up some Phantoms to take the hit. Or if you want to lure out dangerous opponents, have a Phantom act as bait. There is no downside to this as Lyn's Phantoms are 100% disposable and will disappear when Lyn's Engage wears off. <br><br>

The other benefit of Call Doubles is the Chain Attack potential. Having 4 allies who can Chain Attack as long as they are on the map, lets you rack up a lot of damage on enemies. The only downside is that the Phantoms will only Chain Attack for Lyn's user and no one else. <br><br>

The Class Bonuses are pretty decent. Dragons getting 5 Doubles means more lures and Chain Attacks while Doubles created by Flying Units are slightly better Dodge Tanks. Even though Covert Units don't get a Class Bonus, the Doubles they create still benefit from the doubled evasion bonus they receive from rough terrain. So if you have a Covert Unit in cover use Call Doubles. Those Doubles will be hard to hit, making them perfect distractions for the enemy. <br><br>

Despite Call Doubles having so many uses, be warned of its downsides. Using Call Doubles takes a turn which means Lyn's user cannot attack after summoning them. Enemies killed by Lyn's Doubles do not award experience to anyone, not even Lyn's user. So be careful that they don't steal valuable experience from your units. <br><br>

Fun Fact: This Engage Skill is a callback to Lyn's Critical Animations back in her home game where she would produce afterimage clones of herself before striking the enemy. <br><br>

## Engage Attack

| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/lyn/FE17_Astra_Storm_Icon.webp) <br>  | Use to launch 5 bow attacks at 30% damage, up to range 10. |


|**Unit Type**|**Bonus**|
|Dragon| Range+5 (15 Spaces) |
|Covert | Range+10 (20 Spaces) |
|Qi Adept | Breaks Target |

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

<b>Astra Storm</b> continues the trend of Lyn being an amazing Emblem. Firstly, each hit of Astra Storm is subject to the "Rush Effect", meaning they can potentially do more damage than advertised. Astra Storm long range, even without class bonuses has several applications, besides being one of the only ways the Player can attack an enemy from long-range. <br><br>

1) <b>Deleting one Flying Enemy</b>. Enemies like Griffin Knights and Wyvern Knights can be difficult to kill, either because they are really fast and difficult to double or their sheer bulk. Astra Storm lets you ignore those two hassles as Engage Attacks cannot miss and Astra Storm will always do bonus damage against them because it requires a Bow to use and Fliers are weak to Bows.<br><br>

2) <b>Aggroing Bosses</b>. In Engage, many chapters only require you to kill the Boss who is usually on the other side of the map. Bosses usually stay stationary so you have to fight your way across the map to get to them. Astra Storm lets you ignore that as once a Boss is attacked, they will immediately begin charging you, meaning you can let the Boss come to you. This makes a large number of Chapters and Paralogues in Engage, much easier to deal with, especially on Maddening Difficulty. If you use Astra Storm on Turn 1 of a chapter and let the enemy Boss come to you, that saves you a lot of work and the potential headache of fighting your way to them. <br><br>

3) <b>The Radiant Bow</b>: Unlike other Engage Attacks like Lodestar Rush, Override, and Blazing Lion, Astra Storm has no Smash Weapons to dramatically boost its damage. However, it does have the Radiant Bow. The Radiant Bow is a magical weapon like the Levin Sword. However, a normal, unforged Radiant Bow boasts a Might of 19 which becomes 57 when used against Flying Enemies. Even without the Effectiveness Bonus, a Radiant Bow Astra Storm is a surprisingly good boss killer, especially against enemies with low Resistance Stats.<br><br>

## Engage Weapons 

| **Bond Lv.** | **Name** | **Might** | **Hit** | **Crit** | **Weight** | **Range** | **Effect** |
| l | ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/lyn/LynKillerBowFE17Sprite.webp) <br> **Killer Bow** | 9 | 75 | 30 | 7 | 2 | - |
| l0 | ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/lyn/ManiKattiFE17Sprite.webp) <br> **Mani Katti** | 6 | 80 | 20 | 5 | 1 | Effective: Cavalry, Armored|


<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

Lyn's biggest weakness (for now at least) is her Engage Weapons. <br><br>

The <b>Killer Bow</b> is lackluster as the only thing it has over a regular Killer Bow is the extra 2 Might. Since Engage Weapons cannot be forged or engraved, you'll get more bang for your buck out of a regular Killer Bow. <br><br>

Lyn's signature <b>Mani Katti</b> is also disappointing. It has the same Cavalry and Armored Effectiveness as Marth's Rapier but Marth's Rapier not only hits slightly harder but is also more accurate, less heavy, and provides an Avoid Bonus. The Mani Katti does have a good Critical Rate but like the Killer Bow, you'll get more mileage out of a regular Killing Edge or even Wo Dao. <br><br>

## Skill Inheritance 

| **Bond Lv.** | **Skill** | **Effect** | **SP Cost** |
|1 | Speed+1 <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/lyn/FE17_Speed_2B1_Icon.webp) |Grants Speed +1. |100 |

|9 |Speed+3 <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/lyn/FE17_Speed_2B3_Icon.webp) |Grants Speed +3 |500 |


<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

Lyn's Skill Inheritance is reasonably affordable across the board, especially for the value they give you.<br><br> 

<b>Alacrity</b> is relatively affordable for what it gives you. However, I only recommend inheriting this on speedy characters as hitting that 9 Speed threshold is a lot harder without support from Lyn's other inheritance.<br><br> 

Lyn's Stat Skill is <b>Speed+</b> and they are by far the Stat Skill that will give the best bang for your SP Buck. Even at the lowest tier, you'd be surprised how much of a difference +1 Speed makes with Doubling Thresholds. Like Sigurd's Canter, the Speed+ Skills are almost universally useful. If you have a unit with an empty skill slot you can't decide what to do with, have them inherit a Speed+ Skill from Lyn.<br><br> 

By contrast, Lyn's Weapon Skill <b>Bow Focus</b> is borderline useless. Bows in Engage have high Hit rates (the lowest is the Longbow with 70% Hit) and Bow-focused classes have high Dexterity Stats so they are accurate enough on their own. <br><br> 

Lyn gives <b>Sword and Bow Proficiencies</b> which are nice to have but on their own, don't lead to any powerhouse classes unless combined with other Weapon Proficiencies. <br><br> 

I saved <b>Speedtaker</b> for last because it's the most complicated to talk about. That 2000 SP cost isn't a lot but for reasons I will not discuss here, Speedtaker gets worse the more units you have it on, besides Lyn's main user. Basically, the more units with Speedtaker, means more competition to secure kills to activate and stack the Speed boosts. For every unit that inherits Speedtaker, that's an extra 5 enemies they have to kill each Chapter to reap the full benefits. Many Engage Players recommend inheriting Speedtaker on at most, 1 other Character. I recommend inheriting both Speedtaker and Alacrity onto a unit that will not be Lyn's main user as the skills complement each other so much.

# **Post Paralogue Gameplay (Bond 11 - 20)** 

## Stat Bonuses

| **Bond Lv.** | **DEX** | **SPD** | **RES** |
| 12 | +3 | +3 | +2 |
| 14 | +3 | +3 | +3 |
| 16 | +3 | +4 | +3 |
| 17 | +4 | +4 | +3 |
| 19 | +4 | +5 | +3 |

Lyn's maxed-out Stat Bonuses are respectable, especially that +5 Speed, making it even easier to hit Doubling Thresholds and trigger Alacrity. 

## Sync Skills

| **Sync Skill** | **Bond Lv** | **Effect** |
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/lyn/FE17_Alacrity2B_Icon.webp) <br> **Alacrity+** |13  | If unit initiates combat with a Spd advantage of 7 or more, unit’s follow-up (if possible) occurs before foe can counterattack.  | 
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/lyn/FE17_Alacrity3B_Icon.webp) <br> **Alacrity++**| 18 | If unit initiates combat with a Spd advantage of 5 or more, unit’s follow-up (if possible) occurs before foe can counterattack.	Sync Skill |


<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

Like Roy, Lyn's higher Bond Levels only give upgrades to her signature Sync Skill Alacrity and that's all she needs to continue her streak of stellar performance. <b>Alacrity++</b> is especially impressive as it shrinks the activation threshold to 5 Speed over the foe. If you've been paying attention to this profile, to double an enemy you need to have 5 more Speed than them. Basically at Bond 18, if you are doubling a foe, Alacrity++ will ALWAYS trigger, letting you possibly one-round an opponent without fear of retaliation. And remember, this is BEFORE factoring in any Speed boosts you get from Speedtaker.

</details>


## Engage Weapons 

| **Bond Lv.** | **Name** | **Might** | **Hit** | **Crit** | **Weight** | **Range** | **Effect** |
| l5 | ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/lyn/MulagirFE17Sprite.webp) <br> **Mulagir** | 16  | 80 | 0 | 9 | 2 | Speed+5. Effective: Dragon |

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

Lyn's final Engage Weapon is arguably one of the best in the game: <b>Mulagir</b>. It has fantastic stats across the board but the real prize with Mulagir is that +5 Speed it grants. Remember this is on top of all the other Speed Lyn gives you when you wear her ring. When you have access to Mulagir, Alacrity becomes even easier to activate and secure kills. Mulagir is so powerful that even non-Physical units and classes can get pretty good mileage out of this and Physical Units become wrecking balls.  <br><br>

<b>Fun Fact</b>: Unlike other Bond 15 Engage Weapons, Mulagir wasn't in Lyn's Home Game, Blazing Sword but it was present in the previous game: Binding Blade. However, because of the Mobile Game Fire Emblem Heroes, Lyn has become heavily associated with this Bow because two of Lyn's different alternate forms use Mulagir as their primary weapon.

## Skill Inheritance

| **Bond Lv.** | **Skill** | **Effect** | **SP Cost** |
|11 | Strong Bond <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/skillinherit.webp)| Unit stays engaged 1 additional turns (4 Turns) |Auto |

|20 | Deep Synergy <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/skillinherit.webp)| Unit's Engage Meter is shortened by one (1) step |Auto |

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

Lyn's higher level Inheritance is incredibly straightforward with upgrades to <b>Alacrity, Speed+, and Bow Focus</b>. The biggest prize here in my opinion is <b>Speed+4</b> which is a steal for only 1000 SP. Alacrity+ and Alacrity++ might seem tempting to put on your fragile, speedy characters but know that you'll be shilling out a good chunk of SP for them. 

</details>






# **Character Builds**

As you can infer from this profile, Lyn is an Emblem who can make almost anyone into a good Combat unit. Thus she is a very in-demand Emblem. However, I've had the best results with the following builds. 

<details>
<summary> Covert Build </summary>

This Build revolves around maximizing the range of Astra Storm to the full 20 Spaces. This Build unfortunately has limited options as the number of playable Covert Classes in Engage is 5. <b>Thieves, Archers, and Snipers</b> get good mileage out of Lyn, the latter two especially as they can use their own, forged Bows with Lyn's Astra Storm. 

</details>


<details>
<summary> Luna Build </summary>

There are 2 Covert Classes in Engage that are exclusive to the character Alcryst (<b>Lord and Tireur d'élite</b>). Alcryst is commonly agreed to be one of Lyn's best users. Not only does he use Bows as his primary weapon, but his Class Skill once promoted is Luna (A chance to ignore half of the foe's DEF/RES when attacking) which is subject to the Rush Effect for EACH hit of Astra Storm, leading to one-round kills. 

</details>


<details>
<summary> General Bow Build </summary>
Multiple classes in Engage use Bows. While most of them will not receive bonuses from Astra Storm or Call Doubles, they are still worth considering for the spot of Lyn's main user. <b>Warriors</b> especially while their Bow rank is low, have very high Strength which when combined with all the Speed Lyn practically showers you in, leads to a deadly combination. 

</details>


# **Final Thoughts** <br>

As the first Lord Western Fire Emblems Fans would have met, Lyn has definitely received the VIP treatment compared to her mediocre performance in her home game. When the devs asked Lyn how much Speed she wanted in her kit, she replied "Yes". She's a fantastic combat Emblem who can turn almost anyone into a One-Round Kill Speedster while also providing support and utility through her Skill Inheritance. Lyn is an Emblem you should not sleep on. Familiarize yourself with her ins and outs and she will shoot down enemies like fish in a barrel without taking a scratch. Her only real weakness is that there's only one of her in the game (Doubles don't count.)
