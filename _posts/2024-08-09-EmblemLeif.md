# **Introduction**
Leif represents the other half of the Jugdral Duology: Thracia 776. Leif is an Emblem that emphasizes flexibility in combat, with multiple weapon types and exploiting the Weapons Triangle. However, while this sounds great on paper, in practice Leif's performance is an entirely different matter. I'm not going to beat around the bush here. Leif is often called the "Worst" Emblem in the game. I both agree and disagree with this opinion. At first, this statement is true. HOWEVER, that changes once you realize that Leif isn't designed for Combat like Marth, Celica, and Sigurd, but rather Utility. Then you realize he's arguably one of the best Emblems in the game. 

# **Initial Gameplay (Bond 1 - 10)** 

## Stat Bonuses

| **Bond Lv.** | **HP** | **DEF** | **Build** |
|1  | +3 | +1 | +3 |
|3  | +3 | +1 | +4 |
|6  | +5 | +1 | +4 |

*Wearing Leif's Ring grants bonuses to HP, DEF, and most importantly **Build**. Remember back in Sigurd's profile where I said there were only 3 Emblems who passively raise Build. Leif is one of those Emblems and he gives the biggest Build bonus by far. However, his boosts to Build don't stop at his passive stats but that's for later.*


## Sync Skills

| **Sync Skill** | **Bond Lv** | **Effect** |
| ![Pic](/img/leif/FE17_Arms_Shield_Icon.webp) <br> **Arms Shield** |1  | When unit has weapon advantage, unit takes 3 less damage. | 
| ![Pic](/img/leif/FE17_Vantage_Icon.webp) <br> **Vantage**|3  |If unit’s HP is 25% or less and foe initiates combat, unit can counter before foe’s first attack.  |
| ![Pic](/img/leif/FE17_Arms_Shield2B_Icon.webp) <br> **Arms Shield+**|7  | When unit has weapon advantage, unit takes 5 less damage. |

***Arms Shield** gives another reason to keep the Weapon Triangle in mind aside from Breaking. That -3 and -5 Damage reduction can add some decent bulk to your units and improve their survivability.* 

*However, Leif's best Sync Skill is **Vantage**, one of the useful skills in any Fire Emblem game where it's present. At this level, that %25 or less HP threshold might seem like a big ask, considering you essentially have to be one or two hits away from dying for it to trigger. To get the most mileage out of this skill it's best combined with high Crit Rate weapons like Killer Weapons to bank on landing a Crit that will kill the enemy before they can finish you off. However, if you've been around the online communities surrounding Engage, there's one phrase I'm sure you've heard **"Vantage+Wrath Combo"**. Wrath is a Sync Skill granted by a later Emblem but let me say that this Build is one of the most broken Builds in Engage and is definitely worth running. You should have someone (preferably with a high STR stat/growth) inherit Vantage from Leif to set the groundwork for this Build.*


## Engage Weapons 

| **Bond Lv.** | **Name** | **Might** | **Hit** | **Crit** | **Weight** | **Range** | **Effect** |
| l | ![Pic](/img/leif/LeifKillerAxeFE17Sprite.webp) <br> **Killer Axe** |11  |65  |30  |11  |1  | - |
| l0 | ![Pic](/img/leif/MasterLanceFE17Sprite.webp) <br> **Master Lance**|7  |55  |0  |16  |1-2  |If user initiates combat, attacks twice.|
| l5 | ![Pic](/img/leif/LightBrandFE17Sprite.webp) <br> **Light Brand**|15  |75  |20  |6  |1-2  |LUCK+10. Magic Weapon. |
| N/A | ![Pic](/img/leif/MasterBowFE17Sprite.webp) <br> **Master Bow**|6  |65  |0  |0  |14  |Only used during Engage Attack.  |

*You might notice that Leif has 4 Engage Weapons compared to the standard 3 we've seen so far. Normally I hold off on the Bond 15 Weapon until the 2nd half of these profiles but I make an exception for Leif because, unlike other Emblems, Leif's Engage Weapons play a huge role in how his Engage Skill and Engage Attack operate.* 

*The **Killer Axe** is a decent Engage Weapon and synergizes well with Leif's Vantage. That 11 Weight might look heavy but remember that to even use Leif's Killer Axe, you have to wear his Ring in the first place and his Ring boosts Build so that axe might not weigh you down as much as you'd think.*

*The **Master Lance** is arguably the single worst Engage Weapon in the entire game and you only have to look at its stats to see why. Low Might, low Accuracy and it's incredibly heavy. Seriously at 16 Weight, even with Leif's passive boost to Build, most of your characters are getting weighed down by this thing. However, the real reason the Master Lance gets such a bad rep is how it works with Leif's Engage Skill.*

*The **Master Bow** is only used during Leif's Engage Attack which we'll discuss later. Even if you could use it in normal combat, its stats are terrible.*

*Finally, we have the **Light Brand**. It's a magical weapon, something that makes it stand out among Bond 15 Weapons. You've read me gush about the Levin Sword before and how it's one of the best weapons in Engage. Well, the Light Brand is a pretty decent sidegrade to it. It trades some accuracy for higher might, critical rate, and much lower Weight. That LUCK boost can be handy as an insurance policy against enemy criticals. However please remember that, unlike Leif's other Engage Weapons, the Light Brand is Magical, so you'll need a good MAG stat to do decent damage with it.*


## Engage Skill

| ![Pic](/img/leif/FE17_Adaptable_Icon.webp) <br> **Adaptable** |If foe initiates combat, unit counters with the "**best**" weapon available (in terms of range, weapon advantage, effective bonus, etc.). |


|**Unit Type**|**Bonus**|
|Dragon|Hit+30 during Combat |
|Backup|Crit+10 during Combat |
|Covert|Avoid+20 during Combat |
|Armored|DEF+5 during Combat |
|Flying|RES+5 during Combat |

*And finally, we come to the reason Leif is so heavily disliked and sometimes outright hated by Fire Emblem players. His Engage Skill, **Adaptable**. Now you might noticed in this profile I discussed all of Leif's Engage Weapons, first before his Engage Skill and Attack. I switched things up here because you need the context his Engages Weapons provide to understand why Leif's Engage Skill and Attack are not well regarded.*

*On paper, Adaptable sounds like an alright Sync Skill as it synergizes with Vantage and prioritizes the Weapons Triangle so Arms Shield will activate and reduce the damage you take. The fact that almost every Unit Type in the game gets a Bonus from Adaptable is just the cherry on top. In practice, however, there are a lot of factors that hold this skill back.*  

*You might have noticed that in this skill's description, I put "best" in bolded quotes because it's the crux of this issue. Leif's AI has a very strange definition of "best" and a YouTuber summed it up perfectly.* 

**"... Leif's idea of "best" weapon is suboptimal at best and outright suicidal at worst"**.

*The in-game description doesn't tell you this but Adaptable prioritizing avoiding Break (Weapon Triangle Disadvantage). Say for example you have a Sword equipped and a Lance Enemy attacks you. Adaptable will have you switch to Leif's Killer Axe to avoid Break and active Arms Shield. The problem is that Leif's AI doesn't pay attention to the **WEIGHT** of the weapon. As I've pointed out, Leif's Engage Weapons are rather heavy, especially the Master Lance. Say, for example, you are Engaged with Leif and have an Iron Axe in your inventory alongside Leif's Killer Axe and Master Lance. A Sword Enemy attacks you and Adaptable triggers with 2 options. Keep in mind that most Sword Units have high SPD stats.*

1) Keep the Iron Axe Equipped. You get broken but you only take one hit for **13 Damage**.

2) Switch to the Master Lance. You aren't broken when hit and Arms Shield+ activates. However, the Master Lance weighs you down so much that the enemy now has 5 more SPD than you. You get attacked **TWICE** for a total of **16 Damage**. 

*Leif will almost always pick option 2 because, as stated before, Leif's AI prioritizes avoiding Break and doesn't care if the Master Lance weighs you down so much that you get doubled. I am not exaggerating when I say that there are numerous horror stories of Adaptable literally getting units **KILLED** because of the Master Lance and I have experienced this firsthand. If that wasn't bad enough, if a Ranged enemy attacks you with either Magic/Bows/Daggers, and you have no other Ranged options (Javelin, Hand Axe, or you haven't unlocked the Light Brand yet), instead of just taking the hit, Leif will force you to equip the Master Lance to counterattack. What's worse is that Arms Shield won't trigger in this scenario because Lances only have Weapon Triangle Advantage over Swords, all the baggage I just described about the Master Lance still applies without Arms Shield to soften the hits.* 

*You might be thinking, "If this Skill is so bad, then I'll just have only one weapon in my inventory so Adaptable can't trigger.". That won't work because Adaptable is an Engage Skill meaning you have to be in Leif's Engage Form to use it. Once you're in an Emblem's Engage Form, you automatically have access to at least one of their Engage Weapons, meaning you will always have multiple weapons to trigger Adaptable.* 



## Engage Attack

| ![Pic](/img/leif/FE17_Quadruple_Hit_Icon.webp) <br> **Quadruple Hit** | Use to attack once with each of Leif's Engage Weapons. <br>(Works even if you have not unlocked all of Leif's Engage Weapons.) |

|**Unit Type**|**Bonus**|
|Dragon|+20% Damage |
|Qi Adept |Breaks Foe |
|Covert |Luck% Chance to obtain 1000 Gold |

*If you thought things couldn't get worse after Adaptable, you'd be wrong. **Quadruple Hit (QH)** is a tier above Adaptable in how terrible it is. When you use QH, you'll notice that it is doing laughably pathetic damage. Unlike Marth's Lodestar Rush and Sigurd's Override which let you use other weapons aside from their respective Engage Weapons such as Smash Weapons, Leif's QH ALWAYS uses his four Engage Weapons, each has its problems. The Killer Axe is fine with its 11 Might but the Master Lance and Master Bow both have pathetic Might of 7 and 6 respectively. The Light Brand, despite having an impressive 15 Might is a Magical Weapon, meaning its damage is based on your MAG stat. All of this means that unless Leif's wearer has good STR and MAG stats, QH isn't going to be doing much damage.* 

*As for Class Bonuses, **Dragons** get increased damage which goes a decent way to not making QH hit like a Wet Noodle. **Qi Adepts** breaking the foe is nice but if your enemy is using a Sword/Axe/Lance, there's a high chance they'll be broken anyway. The **Covert** Bonus may seem strange but it's a nice reference to the "Leif's Blade" weapon in Fire Emblem: Awakening which had a similar mechanic*. 

*If you want to take the risk with Leif's Engage Form for QH, there are ways to patch up its damage.* 

1) **Sword Power**: This is an Inheritable Skill that boosts damage with Swords. We get this skill from an Emblem you obtain around the same time as Leif. For some reason, the skill affects all 4 hits of QH when logically it should only affect the Light Brand hit. However, don't look at a Gift Horse in the Mouth and appreciate this inconsistency. 

2) **Skills**: All 4 Hits are boosted by skills like Alear's Divinely Inspiring and Sigurd's Momentum. There is also the Rush Effect.

*Remember how I said that Leif is an Emblem best suited for Utility? Well, look no further than Leif's Skill Inheritance because Leif has some of, if not THE best Skill Inheritance in the game bar none and it's not even a contest.* 

*The least impressive of Leif's Inheritance are the **Knife Precision** Skills which makes your Knife users more accurate and better Dodge-Tanks.*

***Arms Shield** and **Arms Shield+** can make your bulky units even bulkier and aren't too expensive along with Vantage, which is more than worth its weight in SP not only for regular use but also setting up the infamous Vantage+Wrath Combo. All without the baggage of wearing Leif's Ring.*

*The **Build+** Skills are incredibly useful for pretty much any Unit in the game, regardless of class as having higher Build means a unit is less likely to be significantly weighed down by their weapons. It also helps that they are quite affordable for the sheer value they provide. However, these skills don't hold a candle to the last thing Leif offers.*

*No, you are not hallucinating. Leif gives **SIX (6) Weapon Proficiencies** for Reclassing. For context, Engage has a total of Eight (8) Weapon Proficiencies. If you're wondering why Leif has so many Proficiencies compared to other Emblems who give a maximum of 2. It's a reference to Leif's promoted Master Knight Class in Genealogy of the Holy War where he could use 9 out of the 10 Weapon Types that game had.* 

*I cannot stress enough how insanely impactful this is for Reclassing as Leif opens up the potential for near-infinite Reclassing for your entire army. The only proficiencies Leif doesn't give are Tomes and Arts. Tomes isn't a problem because, by the time you have Leif, you also have Celica and another Emblem, both of whom give Tome Proficiency. By the time you have Leif, you have access to almost EVERY Class in the game. This alone more than makes up Leif's bad combat as no other Emblem in the game comes even close to this amount of Reclassing potential.*

*The bulk of Leif's Skill Inheritance is in his lower bond levels so completing his Paralogue doesn't give you all that much value compared to other Emblem Paralogues, especially considering how difficult it is. However, it might be worth inheriting the upgraded versions of Knife Precision, Arms Shield, and Vantage.* 



# **Character Builds**

Despite saying that Leif is an Emblem designed more for utility than combat, some builds can patch some of Leif's glaring weaknesses.

**Rule of Thumb**: <u>Never Engage with Leif</u>. Leif's Engage Form isn't worth it because Adaptable can get you killed and QH isn't all that great of an Engage Attack unless you have crazy high STR and MAG to make it hit harder than a wet noodle. 

1) **Bond 9 Build**: This involves getting a unit to Bond 9 with Leif and NEVER initiating his B-Rank Bond Conversation which unlocks Bond 10 and the Master Lance. Leif can't force the Master Lance on you if it isn't unlocked. This build is more practical than you'd think as not only does Leif's passive stat bonuses max out at Bond 6 but everything you'd want from Leif's Skill Inheritance can be found below Bond 10. 

2) **Wrath Build**: If you've gone all in and completed Leif's Paralogue for his higher Bond Levels, I'd recommend this build. This involves inheriting the Wrath Skill from a later Emblem onto Leif's main user. Since Leif's user will always have Vantage as a Sync Skill, they can run this build as well for Critical Hit shenanigans. While you could run this build with Leif's Killer Axe, that runs the risk of Adaptable screwing you over. I recommend doing this build with a Killer Weapon with an Engrave that specifically boosts Critical Rate. 

# **Final Thoughts** <br>
Leif's viability as an Emblem depends on how you use him. Leif truly shines off the battlefield as his Skill Inheritance is a massive boon to your entire army as there is something in there that everyone can appreciate. whether it be Vantage, Arms Shield, the Build+ Skills, or his 6 Weapon Proficiencies. 

On the battlefield, however, is where he really shows his cracks. While Leif is at his best as a Utility Emblem, I still think he has some uses on the battlefield. The main issue with Leif's combat is his Engage Form due to how Adaptable can screw you over. It is a good idea to avoid Leif's Engage Form unless you're using him on a unit with enough Build to compensate for his heavy weapons. If not, avoid Leif's Engage Form. You aren't missing out on much by not having Quadruple Hit.
