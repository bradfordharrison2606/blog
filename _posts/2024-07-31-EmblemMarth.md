# **Introduction**
Emblem Marth is the first Emblem you receive in the game, fitting for the Lord who started it all. He represents the Archanea Games, specifically (New) Mystery of the Emblem.

He specializes in Dodge-Tanking, dealing with Armor and Cavalry Foes and attacking multiple times. He is the most straightforward of the Emblems as he is a simple damager dealer who is designed to turn his wearer into a overall better combat unit.

# **Initial Gameplay (Bond 1 - 10)** 

## Stat Bonuses

| **Bond Lv.** | **STR** | **DEX** | **SPD** |
| 1 | +1 | +1 | +1 |
| 2 | +1 | +2 | +1 |
| 4 | +1 | +2 | +2 |
| 6 | +2 | +2 | +2 |
| 9 | +2 | +3 |  +2|

*Marth's Ring grants its wearer boosts to Strength, Dexterity, and Speed, which are all stats any Combat Unit would want. Not only does it give their physical attacks more punch but makes them more accurate and increases their chances of doubling the enemy*


## Sync Skills
Marth's Sync Skills are the following and all of them are inheritable.
| |
| |

| **Sync Skill** | **Bond Lv** | **Effect** |
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/marth/perceptive.webp) <br> **Perceptive** | 1 | If the unit intiates combat (Player Phase), grants Avoid+15 during combat. +1 Avoid for every 4 points of Speed the unit has.| 
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/marth/breakdefenses.webp) <br> **Break Defenses** | 3 | If the unit initiates combat (Player Phase) and Break the foe, you gain an additional attack at 50% damage.  |
| ![Divine Speed Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/marth/unyielding.webp) <br>  **Unyielding**| 7 | At the start of the Player Phase, if unit's HP is 20% or less, restores 20%of unit's max HP.|

 
***Perceptive** makes Marth's wearer a better dodge tank. Now that Player Phase only condition might seem like a pain but it's actually subtle encouragement to attack dangerous foes on the Player Phase. That additional avoid might be enough to dodge an attack, especially on your speedier units like Thieves.* <br>

***Break Defenses** is definitely Marth's Bread & Butter Skill as it encourages players to familiarize themselves with the Break System of Engage. That extra attack, even if it's only at half strength can often be enough to kill an enemy in a single round of combat.* <br>

***Unyielding** is a skill I don't have experience using but given the other elements of Marth's kit, I believe this is to keep your Dodge Tanks healthy in the rare event they do take a hit despite the Avoid bonus Perceptive gives them*



## Engage Skill

| ![Divine Speed Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/marth/divinespeed.webp) <br> **Divine Speed** | Unit performs an extra attack at 50% damage in combat. |


|**Unit Type**|**Bonus**|
|Dragon| Unit recovers HP equal to damage dealt by extra attack.|
|Covert| If the extra attack hits: Poisons foe|


***Divine Speed** is basically Break Defenses except it's ALWAYS active, meaning you're getting an additional attack on both Player and Enemy Phase. However, the true beauty of Divine Speed is that it STACKS with Break Defenses. What this means is that if you're in Marth's Engage Form and break your opponent, that's at least 3 attacks you're getting in. 4 If you're doubling them and 6 if you're using a Brave Weapon. As you'd imagine, Divine Speed on a unit with high Speed, really lets them rack up the damage for reliable 1-Round kills. Keep in mind that Divine Speed doesn't not work with Weapons that cannot double attack such as Smash Weapons* <br><br>
*As for the Class Bonuses, Dragons healing themselves on the extra hit is nice but Covert Units definitely get the best deal as the extra hit from Divine Speed inflicts Poison if it lands. In Engage, Poison is a static debuff that adds "True Damage" to your attacks, +1 Damage for each stack of Poison up to +3 Damage. This really lets not only Marth's wearer amp up their damage but everyone else in your army gets to join in on the fun. However, this Poison effect synergizes dangerously well with Marth's Engage Attack.* 



## Engage Attack

| ![Lodestar Rush Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/marth/lodestarrush.webp) <br> **Lodestar Rush** | Use to launch 7 consecutive sword attacks at 30% damage. Adjacent foe only. |


|**Unit Type**|**Bonus**|
|Dragon| +2 Attacks (9 Hits)|
|Backup| +1 Attack (8 Hits)|
|Mystical| Damage based on Magic (MAG)|


*Overall I find Lodestar Rush to be another example of Marth being "Simple, but Practical". His Engage Attack is basically a "Delete One Enemy" button, especially in the early game. It's best used on dangerous enemies to kill them quickly or on bosses. As long as you aren't targetting something too bulky like an Armor Unit or Marth's user has low Strength, not a lot of enemies are going to survive at least 7 attacks, even if they're at 30% Damage. However do remember that Lodestar Rush can only be used with Swords, either one of your own or with one of Marth's Engage Weapons.* <br>

*The Class Bonuses are all around useful. Dragons getting 9 Hits is especially great as it makes up for Alear not having the best raw Strength Stat, especially in the Early Game. Backup Units only getting 8 Hits might seem like the short end of the stick compared to Dragons but all playable Backup Classes are Physical Classes with decent Strength Stats, meaning they won't mind only having 8 hits. Mystical Units basing the damage on their MAG stat is incredibly useful for units with high Magic Stats.* <br>

*In practical uses cases, if you want to maximize your Lodestar Rush Damage, I suggest using it with either a forged Smash Weapon like a Steel or Silver Blade for the high base Might or with a forged Levin Sword so the damage is calculated using your Magic Stat and hits the foe's RES stat. I lean more towards using Smash Weapons with Lodestar Rush as enemies cannot counterattack when you use Engage Attacks which negates the main drawback of Smash Weapons.* <br> 

*Remember how Divine Speed's Covert Bonus inflicts Poison on the target. This Poison synergizes incredibly well with Lodestar Rush as if you're using it on an opponent with 3 Stacks of Poison, that's +3 Damage to **EACH** hit of Lodestar Rush. In the Late Game Lodestar Rush's odds of killing an enemy decrease noticeably. However, it still has use for softening up especially tough enemies like Bosses. Remember, that enemies can't counterattack when you use Engage Attacks, so it's basically free damage since the enemy can't hit you back.* 

*One last thing that the game doesn't tell you is that Lodestar Rush and Engage Attacks like it have a chance to trigger skills like Sol, Luna, Ignis, Sandstorm, etc on EACH hit of Lodestar Rush. So if the RNG is good to you, you could potentially proc any of these skills and boost your damage. In future guides I will refer to this as "**Rush Effect**" for convenience.*

<br>


## Engage Weapons 

| **Bond Lv.** | **Name** | **Might** | **Hit** | **Crit** | **Weight** | **Range** | **Effect** |
| l | ![Divine Speed Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/marth/MarthRapierFE17Sprite.webp) <br> Rapier | 7 | 95 | 0 | 3 | 1 | Avoid +20. Effective: Armor, Cavalry |
| l0 | ![Divine Speed Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/marth/MercuriusFE17Sprite.webp) <br> Mercurius | 12 | 80 | 0 | 7 | 1 | Double EXP while equipped |

***Rapier** is great in the early game as your answer to Armors and Cavalry, especially when combined with Lodestar Rush. Outside of Lodestar Rush, the Rapier is good for Dodge-Tanking with it's +20 Avoid which stacks with Perceiptive. Unlike Perceptive, this Avoid Bonus is always active as long as you have the Rapier equipped. However, it falls off in the late game due to it's low Might.* <br>

***Mercurius** in my opinion is the real prize. Not only is it pretty good stat-wise but doubling the EXP gained is incredible, especially for early-joining characters who have more time to get to Bond 10 with Marth without needing to use Bond Fragments. Get a character to Bond 10 with Marth, score some kills with Mercurius and watch them snowball. Even in the Late Game, Mercurius' EXP boost is still useful, especially when combined with other EXP boosting skills other Emblems provide.* <br>

*Overall, Marth's Initial Engage Weapons are pretty good across the board. Use the Rapier to exterminate Armor and Cavalry Foes and use Mercurius if you want some extra EXP on a character.* 


## Inheritable Skills 
Marth's other Inheritable Skills are the following.

| **Bond Lv.** | **Skill** | **Effect** | **SP Cost** |
| 1 | Perceptive <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/marth/perceptive.webp) | If the unit intiates combat (Player Phase), grants Avoid+15 during combat. +1 Avoid for every 4 points of Speed the unit has. | 250 |
|1 |Avoid+10 <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/marth/avoidskill.webp) |Grants +10 Avoid |500 |
|2 |Sword Agility 1 <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/marth/swordagility.webp)|Grants Avoid+10 and Crit-10 while using a Sword |500 |
|3 |Break Defenses <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/marth/breakdefenses.webp) |If the unit initiates combat (Player Phase) and Break the foe, you gain an additional attack at 50% damage. |2000 |
|4 |Avoid+15 <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/marth/FE17_Avoid2B15_Icon.webp)|Grants Avoid+15 |1500 |
|5 |Skill Inheritance <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/skillinherit.webp) |Unit can inherit this Emblem's Skills |Auto |
|6 |Sword Agility 2 <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/marth/FE17_Sword_Agility_2_Icon.webp)|Grants Avoid+15 and Crit-10 while using a Sword |1000 |
|7 |Unyielding <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/marth/unyielding.webp) |At the start of the Player Phase, if unit's HP is 20% or less, restores 20%of unit's max HP. |100 |
|8 |Sword Agility 3 <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/marth/FE17_Sword_Agility_3_Icon.webp)|Grants Avoid+20 and Crit-10 while using a Sword |2000 |
|8 |Sword Proficiency <br> ![pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/swordprof.png) |Proficiency with Swords. Required for Promotion/Reclassing to certain Classes |Auto |
|9 |Avoid+20 <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/marth/FE17_Avoid2B20_Icon.webp) |Grants Avoid+20 |2500 |


*Marth's Skill Inheritance is a mix of cheap and expensive.* 

***Break Defenses** is the main prize here but fittingly for what it does, it is very expensive, even by Late Game standards. In the Early Game, you're affording this unless you make liberal use of the well and skirmishes.*

***Perceptive** and **Unyielding** are pretty dirt cheap for the effects they give you. Personally, between these two I usually go with Perceptive as that Avoid bonus is really handy in the Early Game as most of your units aren't all that bulky and the extra avoid could save them for taking a hit.*

*Every Emblem in Engage has Inheritable Skills that grant bonuses to either stats, either boosting your raw stats or granting bonuses when using specific weapon types. For Marth, his **Stat Skills** are the **Avoid+** and **Sword Agility** Skills. The Avoid+ I find to be useful as again, you can never have too much avoid. However, they are expensive, especially at higher levels. The highest I go with these skills is Avoid+15.* 

*Marth's **Sword Agility** may seem counterintuitive. Why would you sacrifice Crit Chance for more avoid. Well 2 Things. 1) Notice how the Avoid bonus increases with higher levels of the skill but the Crit penalty remains the same. 2) Engage has many tools that can boost your Critical Rate to near comical levels (Engraves, Certain Inheritable Skills, etc) so most of the time that -10 Crit won't be much of an issue. Even if you aren't running a Crit Build, the extra Avoid is always helpful, especially since Sword units in Engage tend to be better Dodge-Tanks.*

*Lastly, Marth's only **Weapon Proficiency** is Swords which may seem lacklustre but there are many good classes in Engage that open up once a Unit has Sword Proficiency. The standout examples being Mage Knight and Griffin Knight for Levin Sword usage and Hero for better Chain Attack Utility. The main downside is that you get this from Marth at Bond 8 when there is another Early Game Emblem that teaches Sword Proficiency a bit earlier*



# **Post Paralogue Gameplay (Bond 11 - 20)** 

## Stat Bonuses

| **Bond Lv.** | **STR** | **DEX** | **SPD** |
| 13 | +2 | +3 | +3 |
| 14 | +3 | +3 | +3 |
| 17 | +3 | +4 | +3 |
| 19 | +3 | +4 | +4 |


## Sync Skills
Marth's Later Sync Skills are the following and all of them are inheritable.
| |
| |

| **Sync Skill** | **Bond Lv** | **Effect** |
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/marth/FE17_Unyielding2B_Icon.webp) <br> **Unyielding+** | 12 | At start of player phase, if HP is 30% or less, restores 30% of unit’s max HP. 
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/marth/FE17_Perceptive2B_Icon.webp) <br> **Perceptive+** | 16 | If the unit initiates combat, grants Avo+30 during combat. 1 Avoid for every 4 points of Speed the unit has.  |
| ![Divine Speed Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/marth/FE17_Unyielding++2B_Icon.webp) <br>  **Unyielding++**| 19 |At start of player phase, if HP is 40% or less, restores 40% of unit’s max HP.|

*The rest of Marth's Sync Skills are just upgrades on his main two. **Perceptive+** grants 30+ Avoid which is pretty impactful, especially for your speedy units which you should have by the time you unlock this skill.*

***Unyielding+** and **Unyielding++** not only increase the amount of HP you recover but also decreases the activation threshold, meaning you won't have to be on death's door for them to trigger.* 

*Overall, Marth's later Sync Skills double down on making his wearer a good Player-Phase Dodge-Tank with built in some built-in survivability measures in the rare instances they take a hit.* 



## Engage Weapons 

| **Bond Lv.** | **Name** | **Might** | **Hit** | **Crit** | **Weight** | **Range** | **Effect** |
| l5 | ![Divine Speed Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/marth/MarthFalchionFE17Sprite.webp) <br> Falchion | 12 | 100 | 0 | 10 | 1 | Effective: Dragon |

***Falchion** at Bond 15 isn't anything to write home about. It isn't that different to the Mercurius except it has Dragon Effectiveness instead. Normally Dragon Effectiveness isn't all that special in Engage. HOWEVER, by the time you have access to Falchion, you also have access to another Emblem that turns Dragon Effectiveness into **FELL DRAGON** Effectiveness which is incredibly useful for the Final Boss. So I usually don't give Falchion as much flak compared to its other Dragon-Slaying compratriots for this reason.* <br>


## Skill Inheritance

| **Bond Lv.** | **Skill** | **Effect** | **SP Cost** |
|11 | Strong Bond <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/skillinherit.webp)| Unit stays engaged 1 additional turns (4 Turns) |Auto |
|12 | Unyielding+ <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/marth/FE17_Unyielding2B_Icon.webp)|At start of player phase, if HP is 30% or less, restores 30% of unit’s max HP. | 200|
|13 |Sword Agility 4 <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/marth/FE17_Sword_Agility_4_Icon.webp)|Grants Avo+25 at a cost of Crit-10 when using a sword. |3000 |
|14 |Avoid+25 <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/marth/FE17_Avoid_B25_Icon.webp)|Grants Avoid +25 |3500|
|16 |Perceptive+ <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/marth/FE17_Perceptive2B_Icon.webp)|If the unit initiates combat, grants Avo+30 during combat. 1 Avoid for every 4 points of Speed the unit has. |500 |
|17 |Sword Agility 5 <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/marth/FE17_Sword_Agility_5_Icon.webp)|Grants Avo+30 at a cost of Crit-10 when using a sword. |4000 |
|18 |Unyielding++ <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/marth/FE17_Unyielding++2B_Icon.webp)|At start of player phase, if HP is 40% or less, restores 40% of unit’s max HP. |300 |
|19 |Avoid+30 <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/marth/FE17_Avoid2B30_Icon.webp)|Grants Avo+30. |4500 |
|20 | Deep Synergy <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/skillinherit.webp)| Unit's Engage Meter is shortened by one (1) step |Auto |


*The rest of Marth's Skill Inheritance continues the trend of being either dirt cheap and stupidly expensive with no middle ground. The main point against Marth's later Inheritance is that by the time you get access to them, they will have an absurd amount of competition for your SP and Skill Slots from the Base Game Emblems alone. I don't blame you if you disregard inheriting Skills from Marth at that point.* 

*However, if you're considering inheriting skills from Marth's higher Bond Levels, I recommend sticking to **Unyielding+**, **Unyielding++**, and **Perceptive+**. Not only are these reasonably priced but you are definitely getting the biggest bang for your buck. Perceptive+ might only be active during Player Phase but +30 Avoid is still useful, especially for only 500 SP.* 
 
*However, if you are deadset on making a nigh-untouchable Sword Dodge-Tank, I won't stop you from going all in on the **Avoid+** and **Sword Agility Skills**. I hope you've been saving up those Skill Books from the well because with how expensive these skills are, you're going to need them.*





# **Character Builds**
From personal experience, the way I run Marth depends on whether I'm in the Early or Late Game. In the Early Game, I prefer to staple Marth to Alear so they can get to Bond 10 as fast as possible for Mercurius and its EXP doubling. Engage is a game where you want to promote unit as soon as they reach Lv. 10 and Alear is no exception as Divine Dragon is a good promoted class. However, if there's an early joining Unit I want to take to the end, they usually get Marth so they can start snowballing.

By the time you get Marth back in the Late Game, you have so many options for builds involving him. I default to one of the following three.

1) **The Physical Build**: Equip Marth to a physical unit, preferably a Sword Backup Unit who has enough speed to reliably double enemies and strength to make up for the Rapier's lacklustre might against Armored Foes. Most promoted Sword Units can use at least a Steel Blade to pump up the raw damage of Lodestar Rush's 8 Hits. 

2) **Thief Build**: Equip Marth to a Thief to captialize on the Poison Bonus Covert Units receive from Divine Speed so not will Lodestar Rush do more damage but other units in your army will as well. Since Thieves are Covert Units, they get Avoid bonuses from terrain doubled which stacks with Marth's Perceptive to make them almost impossible to hit. 

3) **The Levin Sword Build**: Equip Marth to either a Sword Mage Knight or Sword Griffin Knight with a Levin Sword. The Levin Sword is already one of the best weapons in Engage and combined with Marth's abilities like Break Defenses and Divine Speed, can dish out even more damage. Lodestar Rush with a Levin Sword pumps out respectable damage numbers, especially against Armored Foes who have enough raw defense to ignore the Rapier's Effectiveness Bonus but have poor Resistance that lets the Levin Sword shred through them like paper. While Cavalry and Flying Units don't get any bonuses from Marth, this build more than makes up for it. 


# **Final Thoughts** <br>
Emblem Marth is an Emblem I find to be this game's example of "Simple, but Practical". His kit isn't all that complex as it can be boiled down to "Do More Damage, Dodge More Attacks." which isn't a bad thing, especially in the Early Game as you will need the damage and evasion Marth provided. 

Lodestar Rush is great for wiping enemies off the map or weakening Bosses while the Mercurius is an amazing Engage Weapon, especially in the Early Game for power leveling your units. Even in the Late Game he can still put in alot of work if you use in certain builds. 

In terms of Inheritable Skills, I find Marth to be a mixed bag. The skills you'd actually want to inherit from him (Break Defenses, Avoid+, Sword Agility) are all stupidly expensive and his cheap inheritable skills are also his Sync Skills, meaning they are free on his bearer. Marth's Skill Inheritance is only worth it if you are specifically running a universal Dodge-Tank Build who can dodge on both Phases. 

Despite this, Marth has one problem that seriously hurts his viability. Out of the 6 Emblems you lose at the end of Chapter 10, Marth is gone the longest by far. You don't fully get him back until Chapter 23. By that your team and their builds should already be set in stone, meaning that once Marth comes back, unless you’ve been planning around his absence, you likely won’t have anyone who specifically needs him. However, this isn’t all bad as Marth is designed to be generic enough that he pairs well with just about any type of Unit. In fact, those 3 Builds I suggested I discovered because I had no one who specifically needed Marth. 

Overall Emblem Marth is a decent Emblem, especially for the first one you get. His Engage Skill and Attack are great simply for how simple but effective they are and his Engage Weapons are mostly good. However, he’s weighed down by the cost of his Inheritable Skills that require specific builds to get the most mileage of of them and the fact that he’s absent for entire mid-game.
