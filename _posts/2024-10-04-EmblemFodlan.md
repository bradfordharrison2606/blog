# **Introduction**
Edelgard, Dimitri, and Claude are complicated Emblems (and I'm not just talking about the Discourse). Like the Azure Twins, they are multiple Emblems in one, this time three (3) and they are designed to increase the overall combat abilities of their wearer. However, where the Fodlan Lords differ from the Azure Twins, is you (The Player) have no control over which Emblem is in the lead. 


# Stat Bonuses

| **Bond Lv.** | **STR** | **DEX** | **DEF** |
|1  | +2 | +1 | +1 |
|2  | +2 | +2 | +1 |
|4  | +2 | +2 | +2 |
|7  | +3 | +2 | +2 |
|8  | +3 | +3 | +2 |
|14  | +3 | +3 | +3 |
|16  | +4 | +3 | +3 |
|18  | +4 | +4 | +3 |
|19  | +5 | +4 | +3 |

Wearing the Bracelet of the Three Houses grants boosts to Strength, Dexterity, and Defense. This makes the Fodlan Lords lean more towards Physical Units. You might have noticed that I listed all the Stat Bonuses from Bond 1 to Bond 20. This is because, unlike Base Game Emblems, DLC Emblems have all 20 of their Bond Levels available the moment you acquire them. 

# Sync Skills

## Friendly Rivalry

| **Sync Skill** | **Bond Lv** | **Effect** |
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/rivals/FE17_Friendly_Rivalry_Icon.webp) <br>  Friendly Rivalry| 1 | At start of player phase, the Emblem will randomly switch to Edelgard, Dimitri, or Claude. | 

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

<b>Friendly Rivalry</b> ("Friendly", yeah right.) is similar to the Azure Twins' Night and Day, except that instead of selecting it as a command on the menu, it triggers automatically. At the beginning of every Player Phase (Your Turn), this skill will randomly switch which of the Fodlan Lords is in the lead. This is significant as which Emblem is in the lead has a big impact on two (2) Sync Skills of this Emblem.Remember that it is possible to get the same Lord two Turns in a row when Friendly Rivalry triggers. <br><br>

Lastly, this Skill deactivates the moment you enter the Fodlan Lords' Engage Form. Whichever Lord was in the lead, is locked in for the next 3-4 Turns. This might sound like you need to wait for the right Lord to be in the lead before Engaging but in practice, I find that when Engaged it doesn't matter who was in the lead. Once Engaged, you will have access to all of the Fodlan Lords' Engage Skills and Engage Weapons which we will discuss later.

## Gambit Skills

| **Sync Skill** | **Bond Lv** | **Effect** |
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/rivals/FE17_Gambit_Icon.webp) <br> Flame Gambit | 1 | Use when synced with Edelgard to attack a foe, then set the target foeâ€™s space and nearby spaces on fire. | 
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/rivals/FE17_Gambit_Icon.webp) <br> Shield Gambit | 1 | Use when synced with Dimitri to negate damage from first attacks of ranged foes targeting unit in next enemy phase. |
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/rivals/FE17_Gambit_Icon.webp) <br> Poison Gambit | 1 | Use when synced with Claude to attack a foe, then poison target and all foes adjacent to it after combat. |

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>
The <b>Gambit Skills</b> are a command you will always have access to when Synced with the Emblem of Rivals. There are 3 Gambit Skills and which Gambit you use depends on which Fodlan Lord is currently in the lead. This applies even when Engaged so be mindful of that. <br><br> 

Edelgard grants <b>Flame Gambit</b>. When used, it creates Flame Terrain in a 3x3 square grid around the enemy targeted with this skill. Please remember that, unlike Roy's Blazing Lion, this is not an AoE-style attack. Only the single enemy targeted by this Gambit Skill will be damaged. You would remember back in Corrin's Profile, how I said that Flame Terrain is one of the most useful terrain effects in Engage. <br><br>   
 
Dimitri grants <b>Shield Gambit</b>. You can think of Shield Gambit as a sort of watered-down version of Lucina's Bonded Shield because it only works against foes with ranged weapons (Bows, Daggers, Tomes, etc.). This can be useful if you want to bait out a dangerous ranged foe. <br><br> 

Claude grants <b>Poison Gambit</b>. I've already explained why Poison is good in Engage in previous Profiles so this Gambit is definitely useful. Claude is one of the few ways in Engage to Poison multiple targets in a single action which is useful when you have a bunch of enemies frozen by Augmented Freeze or Dreadful Aura. If you're fighting a tough Boss and Claude is currently in the lead, definitely use this to soften them up.

## Other Sync Skills

| **Sync Skill** | **Bond Lv** | **Effect** |
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/rivals/FE17_Lineage_Icon.webp) <br> **Lineage** | 3 |Grants a 1.2x EXP Multiplier to Unit | 
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/rivals/FE17_Weapon_Sync_Icon.webp) <br> **Weapon Sync** | 12 | If Unit initiates combat using same weapon type as the synced Emblem, grants Atk+5. If engaged, grants Atk+5 regardless of Weapon Type. |
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/rivals/FE17_Weapon_Sync2B_Icon.webp) <br> **Weapon Sync+** | 17  | If Unit initiates combat using same weapon type as the synced Emblem, grants Atk+7. If engaged, grants Atk+5 regardless of Weapon Type. |

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>
<b>Lineage</b> is the most straightforward Sync Skill the Emblem of Rivals provides. That 1.2x Multiplier to EXP might look small on paper, but in practice, it means that whoever is wearing this Bracelet will be slightly ahead of the level curved compared to the rest of your army. <br><br>

<b>Weapon Sync</b> and its upgraded version are simple on paper but complicated in practice. To get that Attack boost, you need to match Weapon Types with whichever Fodlan Lord is leading. If Edelgard is leading, you need to use an Axe. The same concept applies to Dimitri with Lances and Claude with Bows. This means that to get the most out of Weapon Sync, you need to pay attention to which Lord is leading. However, if you're Engaged, you get the bonus, regardless of weapon type. <br><br>

If this skill is inherited, every Emblem in the game has a pre-determined Weapon Type. Below is a table of every Emblem in the game (including DLC Emblems which are Bolded) and their matching Weapon Type. "Special" Weapons means every other weapon type in the game that is not covered by other Emblems (Daggers, Arts, etc.). Since over half of the Emblems on this list correspond to Swords, Sword Units get the most flexibility and value from this skill. <br><br>

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

Like Leif, I switched things up for the Three Houses Lords and want to discuss their Engage Weapons first because they play a big role in both the Engage Skill and Engage Attack of the Emblem of Rivals. <br><br>

The Engage Weapons granted by the Emblem of Rivals are <b>Aymr, Areadbhar, and Failnaught</b>. You might recognize these Engage Weapons as a few of the numerous Engage Weapons provided by Byleth. Stat-wise, these 3 weapons are identical to the versions provided by Byleth. The only difference between them is the color scheme.<br><br>

<b>Aymr</b> not being locked to Dragons is a perk as you could use this with a unit that wouldn't mind taking a hit by attacking second like Generals or Great Knights. <br><br>

<b>Areadbhar</b> is still as good as when it was on Byleth. Since it isn't restricted to Cavalry Units, it lets other high Strength Units and Classes join in the fun. When this weapon's description says "Might+50%". what it means is that Areadbhar's Might is increased from 14 to 21 Might. <br><br>
 
Last but not least, we have <b>Failnaught</b> which I described previously as a Longbow on steroids. This is good for shooting down pesky fliers or attacking from 3 range to avoid taking a hit.

# Engage Skill

| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/rivals/FE17_Combat_Arts_Icon.webp) <br> **Combat Art: Raging Storm** | Attack with Aymr. <br> After combat, Unit gains another action. <br> Cost: 3 Engage Turn(s). |
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/rivals/FE17_Combat_Arts_Icon.webp) <br> **Combat Art: Atrocity** | Attack with Areadbhar (Even if it has not been unlocked) <br> Attack with double Might. <br> Cost: 1 Engage Turn(s). |
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/rivals/FE17_Combat_Arts_Icon.webp) <br> **Combat Art: Fallen Star** | Attack with Failnaught (Even if it has not been unlocked) <br> Atvoid Foes' attacks next combat. <br> Cost: 1 Engage Turn(s). |



|**Unit Type**|**Bonus**|
|Dragon| +10% Damage|
|Covert| Avoid+20 |

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

<b>Combat Arts</b> are a gameplay mechanic returning from Three Houses. However, instead of spending Weapon Durability like in that game, the cost in Engage is "Engage Turns". What this means is that in exchange for accessing these powerful attacks, you have to give up the time you can spend in the Fodlan Lords' Engage Form. For example, if you only have 1 Turn left in their Engage Form and you use a Combat Art with an Engage Turn Cost of 1, you will be left with 0 Engage Turns. Fortunately, being left with 0 Engage Turns doesn't cancel the transformation. You will still be Engaged with the Emblem of Rivals for the incoming Enemy Phase. On your next Player Phase, the Engage Form will end. <br><br>

The Combat Arts of the Emblem of Rivals also have another caveat. You must use the corresponding Engage Weapon. The saving grace is that you have access to all 3 Combat Arts, even if you have not unlocked the related Engage Weapon. So someone at Bond 1 with the Emblem of Rivals, will still have all the Combat Arts when Engaged. <br><br>

Edelgard provides <b>Raging Storm</b> at the cost of 3 Engage Turns. Even if you miss with Raging Storm, you are still given another action as if you were refreshed by a Dance. Keep in mind that since Aymr is a Smash Weapon, you will attack second and likely take a hit from the enemy. <br><br>

Dimitri provides <b>Atrocity</b>. When this skill says "Double Might" what it means is that Areadbhar's Might jumps from 14 to 28 when using Atrocity, making it equivalent to a Smash Weapon's Might. Think of this as a "Kill One Enemy" Button. <br><br>

Claude provides <b>Fallen Star</b>. This skill basically makes you invincible against the next enemy that attacks you after using it. The problem is that since it forces you to use Failnaught, the target must be 2-3 Spaces away. <br><br>

Lastly, please keep in mind that you can only use each Combat Art once per turn and only if you have Engage Turns left to pay the cost. For example, let's say you're at Bond 15 with the Emblem of Rivals where you have 4 Turns while Engaged. If you used Raging Storm followed by Atrocity and you're refreshed by an ally (either Dance or Goddess Dance), you cannot use Fallen Star since you will not have any Engage Turns to pay the cost.

# Engage Attack

| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/rivals/FE17_Houses_Unite_Icon.webp) <br> **Houses Unite**  |Unit attacks with Aymr, Areadhbar, and Failnaught at 50% Damage each.  |
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/rivals/FE17_Houses_Unite_Icon.webp) <br> **Houses Unite+**  |<b>If Byleth is Adjacent</b><br> Unit attacks with Aymr, Areadhbar, and Failnaught at 50% Damage each. After combat, Unit gains another action.  |


|**Unit Type**|**Bonus**|
|Dragon| +10% Damage |
|Cavalry |+10% Areadbhar Damage |
|Covert |+10 Failnaught Damage |
|Armored |+10% Aymr Damage |
|Qi Adept |Breaks Foe |

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

<b>Houses Unite</b> is shared among the 3 Lords and it is pretty much Leif's Quadruple Hit if it was good. Even though you're only attacking 3 Times at 50% Damage, all 3 of this Emblem's Engage Weapons are strong, even with the damage penalty and because you have to be Engaged to use Houses Unit, Weapon Sync will be active to boost the damage. However, what makes Houses Unite hit hard are the Class Bonuses as 4 out of the 8 Class Types increase the damage dealt in one way or another. <br><br>

However, what makes Houses Unite (along with the Engage Attacks of other DLC Emblems) truly broken is the bonus effect you receive if an ally wearing a specific Base Game Emblem Ring is adjacent to them when they use their Engage Attack. This turns the Engage Attack into it's upgraded version. <br><br>

For the Emblem of Rivals, an ally wearing Byleth's Ring must be adjacent to them. This turns Houses Unite into <b>Houses Unite+</b> where you get to take another action after the Engage Attack and this additional action is separate from the additional action granted by Raging Storm. Keep in mind that if Byleth is around, then they could have used Goddess Dance on you, granting yet another additional action for a total of <b>5 Attacks in a single turn</b>. Here's an example where Unit A is synced with the Emblem of Rivals. <br><br>

1) Unit A uses Raging Storm and is given an additional action. <br>
2) Unit A uses that additional action to attack again. <br>
3) Unit A is refreshed by your Dancer for another action and attack. <br>
4) Unit B (wearing Byleth's Ring) uses Goddess Dance on Unit A. <br>
5) Unit A (adjacent to Unit B) uses Houses Unite to attack and gain another action. <br>
6) Unit A attacks one last time. <br><br> 

If you can set this up right, you could potentially wipe out multiple enemies with a single unit, or destroy multiple health bars on a Boss in a single turn.

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

As stated previously, DLC Emblems have all 20 of their Bond Levels available from the start. This means all of their Skill Inheritance is available. You simply need to raise the Bond Level. For DLC Emblems, their Stat and Weapon Skill works differently compared to Base Game Emblems. Their Stat Skills boost 2 Stats while their Weapon Skills are defensive "<b>Guard</b>" skills that decrease damage against specific weapon types. <br><br>

The Fodlan Lords provide <b>Strength/Dexterity+</b> and <b>Bow Guard</b>. Strength and Dexterity are stats every physical unit wants but as we saw with Roy and his Strength+ Stats, the Strength/Dexterity+ Skills are expensive. Bow Guard could be useful for units who don't like fighting Bow Units. I wouldn't recommend Bow Guard on Fliers as the damage reduction isn't enough to negate the Effectiveness Bonus Bows have against Fliers. <br><br>

<b>Assembly Gambit</b> is the only Gambit that can be accessed via Skill Inheritance. The reason this skill exists is because the main 3 Gambits rely on being Synced with either Edelgard, Dimitri, or Claude, the developers had to create a 4th Gambit for when a Unit isn't Synced with any of them. As for the skill itself, it could be useful to pull enemies out of formation but I rarely see this skill being used, even on Maddening. It doesn't help that 1500 SP is asking a lot for a mediocre skill. Fun Fact. Assembly Gambit is the ONLY skill in Engage that is exclusive to Skill Inheritance. <br><br>

<b>Lineage</b> is fantastic as just like Byleth's Mentorship, the SP Cost is a steal for the benefits it provides. Like Sigurd's Canter, I recommend spreading this around your army so they can all get a boost to their EXP gain. If you get the Emblem of Rivals in the Early Game, you can combine this with Marth's Mercurius or Lucina's Parthia to really make your EXP gain skyrocket. <br><br>

<b>Weapon Sync</b> and its upgraded version might look expensive but they are definitely worth the cost. I usually stick with the base version as that +5 Damage is more than enough in most situations. If you're like me and match Emblems to Units who specialize in their Weapon Type (e.g: Marth on a Sword Unit, Lyn on a Bow User, etc.), then you can consider Weapon Sync a universal damage boost even when not Engaged. <br><br>

For Weapon Proficiencies, the Fodlan Lords provide <b>Axe, Lance, and Bow Proficiency</b>. This combination of Proficiencies opens up a wide range of Physical reclass options for your army.

# **Character Builds**

<details>
<summary> 2/3 Weapon Sync </summary>

The Emblem of Rivals performs best on Physical Units, specifically those that are reliable, all-rounder combat units. If you want to get the most out of this, I'd recommend playing into Weapon Sync by putting the Emblem of Rivals on Classes that wield multiple weapons, specifically those that correspond to the Fodlan Lords. The classes I recommend are: <br><br>

<b>Warrior</b> (Axes and Bows)<br>

<b>Wyvern Knight</b> (Axes and Lances) <br>

<b>Great Knight</b> (Axes and Lances) <br><br>

With these Classes, you'll have access to 2 of the 3 Weapons Types that correspond to the Fodlan Lords. This means a 66.6% uptime on Weapon Sync. I especially recommend the first two as Warrior and Wyvern Knight are both fantastic classes in Engage. Warrior if you want 3-Range Chain Attack utility with Failnaught or Wyvern Knight if you want Flier movement. Great Knights being Cavalry Units, get the bonus to Houses Unite for more damage.<br><br>

Unfortunately, there are no Classes in Engage that use Axes, Lances, and Bows all at the same time, so there's no way to have 100% uptime on Weapon Sync when not Engaged. 

</details>




# **Final Thoughts** <br>
For the one DLC Emblem you don't have to work for via completing a Divine Paralogue, The Emblem of Rivals is quite strong. While it may seem complicated at first glance, once you start using it, you'll find that it's a bit simpler to handle. It's a shame that the true extent of their power is locked behind Byleth whose Ring you don't get until the mid-game but the wait is worth it. For the best results, I suggest putting this Emblem on a strong, all-rounder Physical Unit. I guess all that discourse around Three Houses fuels this Emblem's monstrous strength.
