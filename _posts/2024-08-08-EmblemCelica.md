# **Introduction**
Celica represents Fire Emblem Gaiden/Echoes and is the first purely Magic-focused Emblem the player acquires and one of the only ones in fact. Her general playstyle is all about increasing the raw magical firepower of her wearer while giving them bursts of extreme mobility. 

# **Initial Gameplay (Bond 1 - 10)** 

## Stat Bonuses

| **Bond Lv.** | **STR** | **MAG** | **RES** |
| 1 | +1 | +2 | +1 |
| 2 | +1 | +3 | +1 |
| 4 | +1 | +3 | +3 |
| 7 | +2 | +3 | +3 |

*Celica's Ring grants boosts to Strength, Magic, and Resistance. The latter two stats are things dedicated Mages always want more of. That increase in Strength might seem odd but there are a few classes in Engage that can run mixed Physical and Magic offenses like Mage Knights, Griffin Knights, and the special Vidame Class.*


## Sync Skills


| **Sync Skill** | **Bond Lv** | **Effect** |
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/celica/FE17_Holy_Stance_Icon.webp) <br> **Holy Stance** | 1 | If a Corrupted attacks unit, deals 10% of damage taken back to foe. | 
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/celica/FE17_Resonance_Icon.webp) <br> **Resonance** | 3 | When equipped with a tome, if unit’s HP is 2 or more, unit loses 1 HP at start of combat and deals +2 damage during combat. |
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/celica/FE17_Favorite_Food_Icon.webp) <br> **Favorite Food** | 8 | When unit eats a packed lunch, its engage meter is maxed out. |

***Holy Stance** as a Sync Skill isn't all that impressive (for now) as 10% is all that much. It only works during the Enemy Phase and since Mages are normally quite squishy, you don't want to leave them exposed to enemy attacks for this skill to even trigger. But don't worry, Celica has much better ways of dealing with Corrupted Foes*

***Resonance** however is where Celica begins to shine as a magic-focused Emblem. That +2 Damage might not seem all that powerful, but often times in Engage, Mages have trouble doubling non-Armor foes and that extra damage could be enough to finish a foe. However be warned, while that -1 HP cost can't kill Celica's user, it can put them in danger of dying to an enemy attack, so be careful when using it.*

***Favorite Food** is a skill I've found rather niche. It can be used for a gimmicky build with a certain character, but that build is often just for laughs and giggles. Though, if you aren't throwing your Packed Lunches into the Well, this skill can see use for rapid Celica Engages during a chapter. Or it can be used with other Emblems if inherited.*

## Engage Skill

| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/celica/FE17_Echo_Icon.webp) <br> **Echo** | Use to attack with magic at 50% damage. Use a second time to launch another 50% attack. |


|**Unit Type**|**Bonus**|
|Dragon| Range +1|
|Mystical| +10% Damage |

***Echo** is an Engage Skill I undervalued at first, but I've come to see the value in it, mainly with the Mystical Bonus. Since Mystical Units get an extra 10% Damage for each Echo Attack, that's effectively a 20% Damage boost if you're attacking the same target. One application of Echo, is using it to finish off a weakened enemy before using the second Echo to attack another one. Furthermore, if you're running a tome with a high critical rate and you're doubling the enemy, that's effectively 4 chances to score a Critical Hit.* 

## Engage Attack

| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/celica/FE17_Warp_Ragnarok_Icon.webp) <br> **Warp Ragnarok**  | Use to warp up to 10 spaces and make a powerful magic attack.  |


|**Unit Type**|**Bonus**|
|Dragon| Attack Range +1 (3 Range) |
|Cavalry | Warp Distance +2 (12 Spaces) |
|Flying | Warp Distance +5 (15 Spaces) |
| Mystical | +20% Damage |

*How you use **Warp Ragnarok (WR)** depends on whether you're in the Early or Late Game. In the Early Game, WR is basically the magical version of Marth's Lodestar Rush, basically a "Delete One Enemy" Button at regular enemies won't have the RES or sheer bulk to survive it. In the Late Game, WR usually won't one-shot an enemy, but it still has its uses as a mobility tool. The ability to travel at most 15 spaces is pretty handy at times.* 

*As for the class bonuses, Dragons getting 3 Range is nice and the Mystical Bonus off adding raw damage can help with oneshotting enemies. The Cavalry and Mystical Bonuses are interesting. For Cavalry Units, the obvious candidates are Mage Knights since it's a good class in Engage and the best candidates for this class have decent Magic Stats. As for Flyers, there are actually only 4 Flying Tome using Classes in Engage, and they are all locked to specific characters. However, Griffin Knights can get in on the fun. While they don't use Tomes, they still have pretty decent Magic Stats.* 



## Engage Weapons 

| **Bond Lv.** | **Name** | **Might** | **Hit** | **Crit** | **Weight** | **Range** | **Effect** |
| l | ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/celica/SeraphimFE17Sprite.webp) <br> **Seraphim**| 6 | 90 | 0 | 4 |1-2  |Effective: Corrupted |
| l0 | ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/celica/CelicaRecoverFE17Sprite.webp) <br> **Recover** | 40 | - | - | - | - | Healing Staff |
| - | ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/celica/RagnarokFE17Sprite.webp) <br> W.Ragnarok | 15  | -  | - | - | - | Only used during Engage Attack. Cannot Miss/Follow-Up |

***Seraphim** is arguably Celica's best Engage Weapon. While that 6 Might may look pathetic, remember this weapon is effective against Corrupted which make up a huge chunk of enemies in Story Chapters, especially in the Late Game. When fighting Corrupted, this weapon effectively has 18 Might, which is higher than most Bond 15 Engage Weapons. Not only that, but it's also accurate and fairly light, making it easier for Mages to double attack with this.* 

***Recover** isn't anything too special. It's nice to have as an emergency healing staff, but most often you won't need it. There's another Emblem whose MUCH better at using Staves, so Celica is better off on offense than support.*

## Skill Inheritance 

| **Bond Lv.** | **Skill** | **Effect** | **SP Cost** |
| 1| Holy Stance <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/celica/FE17_Holy_Stance_Icon.webp) |If a Corrupted attacks unit, deals 10% of damage taken back to foe. | 100|
| 1| Magic +2 <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/celica/magic+2.png) |Grants MAG +2 | 1000|
| 2| Magic +3 <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/celica/FE17_Magic2B3_Icon.webp) |Grants MAG +3 | 3000|
| 3| Resonance <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/celica/FE17_Resonance_Icon.webp) |When equipped with a tome, if unit’s HP is 2 or more, unit loses 1 HP at start of combat and deals +2 damage during combat. | 2000|
| 4| Tome Precision 1 <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/celica/FE17_Tome_Precision_1_Icon.webp) |Grants Hit/Avo+3 when using a tome. | 100|
|5 |Skill Inheritance <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/skillinherit.webp) |Unit can inherit this Emblem's Skills |Auto |
| 6| Tome Proficiency <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/magicprof.PNG) |Proficiency with tomes. Required for promotion to certain classes. | Auto|
| 7| Tome Precision 2 <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/celica/FE17_Tome_Precision_2_Icon.webp) |Grants Hit/Avo+5 when using a tome. | 300|
| 8| Favorite Food <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/celica/FE17_Favorite_Food_Icon.webp) | When unit eats a packed lunch, its engage meter is maxed out.| 200|
| 9| Tome Precision 3<br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/celica/FE17_Tome_Precision_3_Icon.webp) |Grants Hit/Avo+7 when using a tome. | 700|
| 9| Sword Proficiency <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/swordprof.PNG) |Proficiency with swords. Required for promotion to certain classes. | Auto|

*Like Marth, Celica's Skill Inheritance has some stupidly expensive skills, namely **Resonance** and the **Magic+** Passives. Fittingly as both skills directly boost your damage with Tomes.* 

*Despite being dirt cheap, **Holy Stance** isn't worth inheriting as again, bouncing back only 10% of the damage you take isn't anything to write home about.* 

***Tome Resonance** can be useful on Mages with accuracy issues, especially for how reasonably priced they are.*

*It may be worth it to inherit **Favorite Food** unto someone, especially if you plan on using Marth's Mercurius to power level them. Having back-to-back Engages let's Marth wielders wrack up the EXP.* 

*Interestingly enough, Celica gives some useful Weapon Proficiencies. She gives **Sword Proficiency** and **Tome Proficiency**, both of which are required to Reclass into Mage Knight, one of the better classes in Engage. Sword Proficiency isn't anything special as we can get this from Marth and many other Emblems. Tome Proficiency however is special as Celica is one of only two Emblems in the Base Game to grant this and much earlier than the other Emblem, making her your go-to if you want Tome Proficiency on someone.* 


# **Post Paralogue Gameplay (Bond 11 - 20)** 

## Stat Bonuses

| **Bond Lv.** | **STR** | **MAG** | **RES** |
| 13 | +2 | +4 | +3 |
| 14 | +2 | +4 | +4 |
| 17 | +3 | +4 | +4 |
| 19 | +3 | +5 | +4 |


## Sync Skills

| **Sync Skill** | **Bond Lv** | **Effect** |
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/celica/FE17_Holy_Stance2B_Icon.webp) <br> **Holy Stance**+ | 12  | If a Corrupted attacks unit, deals 30% of damage taken back to foe. | 
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/celica/FE17_Resonance2B_Icon.webp) <br> **Resonance+** | 16 | When equipped with a tome, if unit’s HP is 2 or more, unit loses 1 HP at start of combat and deals +3 damage during combat. |
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/celica/FE17_Holy_Stance3B_Icon.webp) <br> **Holy Stance++** | 18 | If a Corrupted attacks unit, deals 50% of damage taken back to foe. |

*Recall earlier how I said Holy Stance wasn't anything special. That goes out the window because it's upgraded versions **Holy Stance+** and **Holy Stance++** are incredibly useful not just for the increase in reflected damage. By the time you have access to these skills via completing Celica's Paralogue, almost every single generic enemy in Main Story Chapters is a Corrupted, meaning this skill will be constantly activating during the Enemy Phase. I'd avoid putting this on Mages as they are always squishy but this skill is worth putting on bulkier units who see a lot of Enemy Phase combat, to give them some extra damage.*

*Resonance upgrades to **Resonance+** and while I wish the damage boost was bigger, +3 Damage at the same cost of -1 HP is still solid. Though as before, be careful with this skill as that HP penalty can leave with just enough HP that an enemy could kill you*


## Engage Weapons 

| **Bond Lv.** | **Name** | **Might** | **Hit** | **Crit** | **Weight** | **Range** | **Effect** |
| l5 | ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/celica/RagnarokFE17Sprite.webp) <br> **Ragnarok** | 15 | 95 | 10 | 12 | 1-2 |  |

*Celica's final Engage Weapon is **Ragnarok**, the same weapon used for her Engage Attack, except now you can use it as a normal tome that can follow-up. This Engage Weapon is pretty alright by Bond 15 standards, though it is a bit heavy and Mage units don't usually have high enough Build stats to not be weighed down, Be wary of this as the speed penalty can get Celica's user doubled. Oddly enough, Ragnarok stands out among Bond 15 Weapons as it has no secondary effect .*



## Skill Inheritance

| **Bond Lv.** | **Skill** | **Effect** | **SP Cost** |
|11 | Strong Bond <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/skillinherit.webp)| Unit stays engaged 1 additional turns (4 Turns) |Auto |
|12 |Holy Stance+ <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/celica/FE17_Holy_Stance2B_Icon.webp) | If a Corrupted attacks unit, deals 30% of damage taken back to foe| 500|
|13 |Magic +4 <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/celica/FE17_Magic_2B4_Icon.webp) |Grants MAG+4 | 4000|
|14 |Tome Precision 4 <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/celica/FE17_Tome_Precision_4_Icon.webp) |Grants Hit/Avo+10 when using a tome. | 1000|
|16 |Resonance+ <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/celica/FE17_Resonance2B_Icon.webp) | When equipped with a tome, if unit’s HP is 2 or more, unit loses 1 HP at start of combat and deals +3 damage during combat.| 3000|
|17 |Tome Precision 5 <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/celica/FE17_Tome_Precision_5_Icon.webp) |Grants Hit/Avo+15 when using a tome. | 2000|
|18 |Holy Stance++ <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/celica/FE17_Holy_Stance3B_Icon.webp) | If a Corrupted attacks unit, deals 50% of damage taken back to foe.| 1000|
|19 |Magic+5 <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/celica/FE17_Magic_2B5_Icon.webp) |Grants MAG+5 | 5000|
|20 | Deep Synergy <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/skillinherit.webp)| Unit's Engage Meter is shortened by one (1) step |Auto |

*Celica's higher Inheritance are just upgrades of what she gives at lower bond levels.*

***Resonance+** and the **Magic Passives** are still stupidly expensive but may be worth the SP if you're going for a Magic Nuke build.*

***Holy Stance+** and **Holy Stance++** are a steal for how they're priced. Only issue is getting someone to Bond 18 with Celica. I guess it's worth it if you're willing to grind Skirmishes or use Bond Fragements.*



# **Character Builds**

To be honest, out of all the Base Game Emblems, Celica is the one I have the least practical experience with. As I've implied throughout this profile, Celica works best on dedicated offensive Mages. Either:

1) **Mystical Units** like Sages or High Priests, to pump out as much damage from Echo and Warp Ragnarok. 

2) **Mounted Magical Units** like Mage Knights and Griffin Knights. Mage Knights may not get the Mystical Unit bonuses Celica grants but they still benefit from Resonance using Echo with their own tomes. The extra movement from WR is nice bonus. Griffin Knights aren't left out either as while they can't use Tomes and thus benefit from Celica's Resonance, they can still wield magical weapons like the Levin Sword and Flame Lance to benefit from Celica's other magic boosts.  

# **Final Thoughts** <br>

On my initial few playthroughs, I didn't pay Celica that much attention because like Marth, she comes back rather late compare to the other Emblems you lose. However, upon taking the time to use her, she definitely has her perks. Celica definitely shines on pure offensive Mages. I know this is short but there isn't much to really say about Celica. She's designed to make your mages even better.
