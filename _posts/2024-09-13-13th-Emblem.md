# **Introduction**
Alear represents the 2nd Switch Era Fire Emblem Game: Engage. Befitting their status as the final Emblem you obtain in the base game, Emblem Alear is designed to be an Emblem that turns their user into a Combat Powerhouse who continuously gets stronger as the battle rages on. They are designed to exterminate Bosses, Corrupted, and most importantly; Fell Dragons. However, Emblem Alear's power level is directly tied to the bonds they share with their allies. 


# **Engage+**
Because Alear is a controllable character instead of an equipable Emblem Ring, they work differently compared to other Emblems. To use Alear's Engage Form, simply move Alear adjacent to an allied unit and select the "**Engage**+" command from the menu. This will put both Alear and the targeted ally (Whom I will refer to as Alear's Engage Partner) into Alear's Engage Form at the cost of Alear's Engage Meter. 

Like other Emblems, what Sync Skills Emblem Alear gives both themselves and their Engage Partner is determined by Alear's Bond Level with their Engage Partner. However, where Emblem Alear differs is that their Bond Level is not raised by fighting or by using Bond Fragments. Emblem Alear's Bond Level is determined by Alear's Support Rank with their Engage Partner.

|**Support Rank**|**Bond Level**|
|None | 1|
|C |5 |
|B |10 |
|A |20 |
|S |21 |

# **Initial Gameplay** 

## Stat Bonuses

| **Bond Lv.** | **HP** | **SPD** | **DEF** |
| 1 | +5 | +1 | +1 |
| 5 | +7 | +2 | +1 |
| 10 | +10 | +2 | +2 |
| 20 | +15 | +4 | +4 |

The Ring of the Connector grants boosts to HP, Speed, and Defense to both Alear and their Engage Partner. These are all stats any combat unit appreciates, making Emblem Alear good on both Physical and Magical Combat Units.

<summary> Explanation </summary>

With Emblem Alear, Sync Skills is a bit of a misnomer as you cannot "Sync" with Alear. Either you are engaged with them or not. However, for the purposes of gameplay, the game treats these skills are Sync Skills. Do keep in mind that whenever you enter Alear's Engage Form, Emblem Alear's Sync Skills will override whatever Sync Skills provided by Emblems both Alear and their Engage Partner have equipped. This doesn't apply to inherited skills though. <br><br>

<b>Holy Aura</b> is Alear's signature Sync Skill. When it says "Unit is Effective: Fell Dragon" it means that ANY weapon either Alear or their Engage Partner will have triple Might against Fell Dragons, mainly Corrupted Wyrms. However Holy Aura also fixes an issue I've been bringing up consistently in these profiles. Remember how I kept harping on Dragon Effective Weapons? Well once you have Emblem Alear and Holy Aura, those weapons (<b>Falchion, Mulagir, Parallel Falchion, etc.</b>) become much more useful, especially against the Final Boss of Engage. It took at least 22 Chapters but you finally have an answer to those pesky Corrupted Wyrms. <br><br>

<b>Bond Forger</b> and its upgraded version are great for improving your army's accuracy and dodge-tanking capabilities. By the time you have access to this skill, you have at least 12 Emblems at your disposal (Assuming you aren't using DLC) and 14 Deployment Slots for the rest of the Main Story Chapters. This means the majority of your army benefits from this skill, whether you realize it or not. <br><br>

Last but certainly not least is <b>Holy Shield</b> which is fantastic if it negates not only any Effectiveness damage to whatever class you have Alear in but also their innate weakness to Dragon Slaying weapons. This skill is especially great on Flying Units as it negates their primary weakness to Bows.

## Engage Skill

| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/alear/FE17_Attuned_Icon.webp) <br> **Attuned** | If Unit initiates combat and defeats foe, grants Engage Partner +4 to all seven basic stats while engaged. |


|**Unit Type**|**Bonus**|
|Dragon| Extra +1 to all Stats (All Stats +5) |
|Backup| Extra STR+2|
|Cavalry |Extra DEX+2 | 
|Covert |Extra SPD+2 |
|Armored |Extra DEF+2|
|Flying |Extra RES+2 |
|Mystical |Extra MAG+2 |
|Qi Adept |Extra LUCK+12 |

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

Alear's <b>Attuned</b> is simple but incredibly powerful as it encourages you to go at enemies on the Player Phase with both Alear and their Engage Partner. If one of them defeats an enemy, the other receives a stat boost. This means that both units can snowball like crazy as they tear their way across the battlefield. <br><br>

The Class Bonuses are based on the Unit Type of the Alear Engage Duo who initiates combat. For example, say you have. <br><br>

* Alear as a Divine Dragon (<b>Dragon Unit</b>) <br>
* Chloe as a Griffin Knight (<b>Flying Unit</b>). <br><br>

If Alear activates Attuned, then Chloe will get +5 to all her stats due to Alear's Dragon Class Bonus. Next, if Chloe activates Attuned, then Alear will receive +4 to all their stats and the extra +2 Resistance from Chloe's Flying Class Bonus. <br><br>

This makes Attuned an incredibly versatile Engage Skill as everyone gets stronger from this skill along with the Class Bonus. If you want the biggest bang for your buck out of this skill, make sure both Alear and their Engage Partner are decent Combat Units. It really helps if they can make good use of Alear's Engage Weapons which we'll discuss later. For now, let's move on to Alear's Engage Attack.  

</details>

## Engage Attack

| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/alear/FE17_Dragon_Blast_Icon.webp) <br> **Dragon Blast** | Use to make two attacks against an adjacent foe with a Sword and 20 Might magic beam. |
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/alear/FE17_Bond_Blast_Icon.webp) <br> **Bond Blast** | Use to make a sword attack from the unit and Engage Partner (using Lyration) followed by a 20 Might magic beam attack against an adjacent foe. <br> Only usable when Engage Partner is adjacent to User. |


|**Unit Type**|**Bonus**|
|Dragon| +20% Damage |
|Backup |+20% of STR to Sword Hit |
|Mystical |+20% of MAG to Beam Hit |
|Qi Adept |Breaks Foe. |

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

Continuing Emblem Alear's streak of being a unique Emblem is their Engage Attacks, yes plural. Alear has 2 Engage Attacks and which you get depends on whether or not the two members of the Alear Engage Duo are adjacent. <br><br>

Dragon Blast while powerful, usually isn't enough to deplete a Boss's Health Bar from full. However, it is good for softening up Bosses so other units can kill them. Remember that enemies cannot counterattack when you use Engage Skills. Bond Blast, however, is extremely powerful, usually enough to destroy one of a Boss's HP Bars. <br><br>

The main issue with Dragon/Bond Blast is that since the Beam Attack is magic-based, it suffers from the exact same problem as Leif's Quadruple Hit. To get the most damage, you need both Alear and their Engage Partner to have decent Strength and Magic Stats which isn't always the case. Despite this, Dragon/Bond Blast is nowhere near as useless as Quadruple Hit. <br><br>

Dragon/Bond Blast is designed to deal massive damage to the Final Boss when combined with Holy Aura which Alear's Engage Form will always have regardless of Support Rank/Bond Level of their Engage Partner. But there are other applications for these Engage Attacks.<br><br>

The way I use these two Engage Attacks is on Bosses to quickly shred through their HP Bars. You use Dragon Blast to soften up a Boss so another Unit can finish off that HP Bar. Afterward, you use Bond Blast to completely destroy another HP Bar. However, if you're using Corrin and her Draconic Hex, it's best to debuff the Boss first and then blast them. <br><br> 

If want to pull off this combo with relative ease, it's a good idea for either Alear or their Engage Partner to have inherited Sigurd's Canter. After one of them uses Dragon Blast on the Boss, they can move 1 space to the side so the other member of the Duo can come in right next to their Engage Partner and initiate Bond Blast. <br><br> 

Lastly, the Class Bonuses only apply to the Unit who INIATES the Engage Attack.

## Engage Weapons 

| **Bond Lv.** | **Name** | **Might** | **Hit** | **Crit** | **Weight** | **Range** | **Effect** |
| l | ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/alear/LyrationFE17Sprite.webp) <br> **Lyration** | 15 | 90 | 10 | 10 | 1 |  If user defeats foe in player phase, fills adjacent allies' Engage Meters by 1.|
| l0 | ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/alear/DragonsFistFE17Sprite.webp) <br>**Dragon's Fist** | 10 | 85 | 0 | 9 | 1 | Magic Weapon. If user initiates combat, attacks twice. |
| 20 | ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/alear/OligoludiaFE17Sprite.webp) <br> **Oligoludia** | 8 | 90 | 0 | 7 | 1 |Effective: Corrupted. |

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

<b>Lyration</b> is an upgrade of Alear's signature weapon, Libération. This weapon is great because it has stats comparable to your average Bond 15 Weapon. It doesn't stop there as it has the ability to fill up adjacent allies' Engage Meters. If you know what you're doing, you can pull some crazy combos by quickly refilling the Engage Meters of your allies. All it takes is some clever positioning of your units and both members of the Alear Engage Combo. <br><br>

If you're curious about the name, Lyration is believed to be a portmanteau of "<b>Lilac</b>" and "<b>Relation</b>". Lilac Flowers can have a mix of red and blue petals, referencing Alear's hair and in the Japanese Language of Flowers, Lilacs can represent many things, including Friendship which fits Emblem Alear's gameplay. <br><br>

<b>Dragon's Fist</b> is another good Engage Weapon. Unlike other Arts weapons, this one is Magic-based, meaning any Magical Units engaged with Alear have a great combat option for themselves. <br><br> 

<b>Oligoludia</b> at Bond 20 doesn't disappoint either. Despite the 8 Might, this weapon is incredible for the same reason Eirika's Sieglinde is incredible. By the time you have access to this weapon, EVERY generic enemy in Main Story Chapters is Corrupted. This means Oligoludia effectively has 24 Might 99% of the time. This is great for exterminating Corrupted when your stats are pumped up from Attuned. This weapon's name origin is a bit harder to pin down but most sources agree its name is derived from "The Noble Few" translated into Greek "Oi evgenikoí lígoi"

## Skill Inheritance 

| **Bond Lv.** | **Skill** | **Effect** | **SP Cost** |
|10 |Sword Proficiency <br> ![pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/swordprof.png) |Proficiency with Swords. Required for Promotion/Reclassing to certain Classes |Auto |
|10 |Arts Proficiency <br> ![pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/artsprof.png) |Proficiency with Arts. Required for Promotion/Reclassing to certain Classes |Auto |
|20 | Deep Synergy <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/skillinherit.webp)| Unit's Engage Meter is shortened by one (1) step |Auto |


<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

Emblem Alear has no Skill Inheritance. Instead, they grant both <b>Sword and Arts Proficiency</b> at Bond 10 (Support Rank B). This makes Alear the only Base-Game Emblem other than Byleth to grant Arts Proficiency. <br><br>

Another thing to note is that once you unlock Emblem Alear after completing Chapter 22, every Unit in your army who had a Support Rank of B or higher with Alear will automatically gain both of these Proficiencies if they didn't already have them.

# **Post Paralogue Gameplay** 



## Sync Skills

| **Sync Skill** | **Bond Lv** | **Effect** |
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/alear/FE17_Boon_of_Elyos_Icon.webp) <br> **Boon of Elyos** | 21 | If unit initiates combat, grants bonus to Crital Rate and Dodge (Critical Avoid) equal to 2× the number of allies who have acted this turn. | 


<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

Completing Alear's Emblem Paralogue allows them to obtain an S Support Rank with a single character per playthrough. If Alear engages with this character, both of them will have the only Bond 21 Sync Skill in the entire game; <b>Boon of Elyos</b>. <br><br> 

Boon of Elyos encourages you to have Alear and their S-Support attack last in a turn. On Story Chapters with 14 Deployment Slots, that effectively a +26 to your Critical Rate which is nice. When this skill says "number of allies who acted this turn" it means everyone who has used their turn and cannot act. So if you refresh a unit via Dance or Goddess Dance, the game considers them as not having acted and thus, will weaken the effects of Boon of Elyos unless they use their 2nd action. <br><br> 

You might think to leverage this with a high Critical Weapon like a Killer Weapon with Lyn's or Corrin's Engraving but at that point, your Critical Rate is already so high that you don't need it. <br><br> 

Boon of Elyos is a skill that is mostly an afterthought as it isn't that impactful to have full-on debates/discussions about "Optimal S-Support Partners." So you can have Alear S-Support whoever you want without losing much. <br><br> 

</details>



# **Character Builds**


Unlike other Emblems, I do not have any specific builds for Emblem Alear. They are designed to make themselves and their Engage Partner extremely powerful for 3-4 Turns. Thus I am going to go over some Rules of Thumb to get the most out of Emblem Alear regardless of Emblem Alear.

<details>
<summary> Power of Friendship </summary>

Since Emblem Alear's strength is determined by their Support Level with their Engage Partner, it is a good idea to get Alear to an <b>A-Support</b> Rank with everyone in your main army. That way Alear's Engage Form will be at it's strongest, regardless of their Engage Partner. This shouldn't be too difficult as if you've been paying attention to the Somniel, you should have amassed enough presents to give to characters to raise their Support Ranks.

</details>

<details>
<summary> Engage Vs. Engage+ </summary>
Please remember that you don't always have to use Alear's Engage Form. You can still use the Emblem Alear has equipped to themself instead. Despite Alear's Engage Form being among the most powerful in the game, there are situations where they are not the best option. For example, if Alear has Lucina equipped, it might be better to Engage with Lucina for Bonded Shield instead of activating Engage+.


</details>

<details>
<summary> Timing. When to use Engage+ </summary>

From my experience, the best time to use Engage+ is at the beginning and very end of a Chapter. Using it at the beginning allows for a powerful start to the chapter as Alear and their Engage Partner hit the front lines of the enemy hard. By the time you reach the Boss at the end of the Chapter, Alear's Engage Meter should be refilled for another round of Engage+.

</details>

<details>
<summary> Canter </summary>

If you want to get the most out of Bond Blast and Dragon Blast, then make sure that at least one member of the Alear Engage Duo has <b>Canter</b>. I recommend putting Canter on Alear as they are required for Engage+ and you don't have to spread around Canter to everyone in your main army. 

</details>


<details>
<summary>  Favorite Food </summary>
The Sync Skill <b>Favorite Food</b> from Celica fully refills your Engage Meter when you eat a Packed Lunch. On Alear, it means they can use Engage+, wreak havoc for 3-4 Turns, and then recharge their Engage Meter by taking a quick lunch break. This is great if you're about to fight the Boss of a Chapter and Alear's Engage Meter hasn't recharged yet.


</details>

# **Final Thoughts** <br>
I find Emblem Alear to be a fitting reward for making this far into the main story. As Alear's "<b>Super Mode</b>" they turn themself and their Engage Partner into combat powerhouses who get stronger as they roam the battlefield. Once you have this Emblem, there is nothing that can stand up to the sheer power of the miracle granted by the 12 Emblems. Use the powers of the 13th Emblem wisely, and watch your enemies fall one after the other.
