# **Introduction**
Sigurd represents the 1st Game of the Jugdral Duology: Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War. Sigurd's gameplan can be summed up in a single word: **Movement**. Sigurd's entire playstyle is focused around granting additional movement and mobility to his bearer and using that to boost their damage. The same applies to those who inherit his skills.

# **Initial Gameplay (Bond 1 - 10)** 

## Stat Bonuses

| **Bond Lv.** | **DEX** | **DEF** | **BUILD** |
| 1 | +1 | +1 | +1 |
| 2 | +1 | +2 | +1 |
| 4 | +2 | +2 | +1 |
| 8 | +2 | +2 | +2 |

| All | MOV + 1 |

*Sigurd's Passive Stat Boosts are interesting in that he raises **Build**, a stat is difficult to increase without help from other Emblems and he is one of three Emblems to do this, the 3rd of which is DLC. More interesting is that Sigurd increases his bearer's **Movement** which is completely unique to him.*


## Sync Skills


| **Sync Skill** | **Bond Lv** | **Effect** |

| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/sigurd/FE17_Momentum_Icon.webp) <br> **Momentum** | 3 | Grants Atk+1 to first attack during combat for each space unit moved before attacking. (Max +10) |
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/sigurd/FE17_Headlong_Rush_Icon.webp) <br> **Headlong Rush** | 7 | Grants Immunity to Freeze |

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

<b>Canter</b> is Sigurd's best Sync Skill and one of the best Inheritable Skills in the game. Unlike previous Fire Emblem Games, Canter isn't using up the rest of your movement. It's always a flat 2 Spaces. However, that 2 Spaces lets a unit get into a more favourable position after attacking or healing to make room for other units to do their thing. One thing to clarify though. When I use the term "acting" in this skill's description, what I mean is any action that would give you EXP. This includes attacking, healing, dancing, etc. So if you're in the Fell Xenologue where you can't gain EXP, don't worry because Canter will still trigger. <br><br>

At first glance <b>Momentum</b> might seem like a niche Skill in Engage, given the movement for classes cap out at 5 and 6 for Foot and Mounted Classes respectively. However, when we get to Sigurd's Engage Skill and Engage Attack, you'll see why this skill is incredibly useful. Aside from that, please note that the added damage from this skill only applies to the <b>FIRST HIT</b> of an attack. So if you're doubling, only the first attack will receive the bonus. <br><br>

<b>Headlong Rush</b> is another example of a "Boring, but Practical" Skill. Freeze is a status effect that prevents you from moving for a few turns which can be incredibly annoying when it lands. However, I <b>HIGHLY RECOMMEND</b> spreading this around to as many people in your army as possible before Chapter 10. Trust me, you are going to need this skill. This is especially true for Alear as let's just say, in Chapter 11 Alear getting Frozen is the absolute LAST thing you want happening. <br><br>

## Engage Skill

| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/sigurd/FE17_Gallop_Icon.webp) <br> **Gallop** | Grants MOV+5 |


|**Unit Type**|**Bonus**|
|Dragon| Grants another MOV+1 (MOV+6) |
|Cavalry | Grants another MOV+2 (MOV+7) |
|Covert | Unit does not pay extra movement cost over any terrain|

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

When in Sigurd's Engage Form, you activate one of the simplest but effective Engage Skills in the game <b>Gallop</b>. The ability to suddenly move 5 more spaces than usual is incredible. because it is the lynch-pin of Sigurd's kit while Engaged. <br><br>

Remember earlier when I said Momentum seems rather niche. Well that changes when you add +5 Movement to the equation. With the extra movement granted by Gallop, it is easy to hit the +10 Damage cap of Momentum for serious damage. Don't be surprised if this lets rack up some seriously high damage numbers, especially when combined with one of Sigurd's Engage Weapons. <br><br>

As for Class Bonuses, Dragons and Cavalry Units just add more movement onto of all the crazy movement Gallop gives at base. Cover Unit definitely get a great deal with them essentially having almost unrestrcited movement across the battlefield save for terrain only Fliers can cross (Water, Mountains, etc). <br><br>

</details>




## Engage Attack

| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/sigurd/FE17_Override_Icon.webp) <br> **Override**| Use to attack and move through a line of adjacent foes. Sword/lance only. |

|**Unit Type**|**Bonus**|
|Dragon|  +20% damage.|
|Armored | 10% Chance of Breaking Target |
|Qi Adept | 20% Chance of Breaking Target |
|Mystical | Deal extra Damamge = 25% of MAG |

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>


Sigurd's Engage Attack <b>Override</b> is one of the few ways in Engage of damaging multiple enemies in a single action. However, one interesting thing about Override that the game doesn't tell you is that there is basically no upper limit to the enemies this skill can damage, as long as there is an empty space on the side of the line of enemies. Theoretically, if you somehow managed to get 10 enemies in a line and use Override, Sigurd will run through and damage ALL OF THEM. This gets comical if all of the enemies hit by Override are Cavalry and you use Sigurd's first Engage Weapon. <br><br>

The Classes Bonuses are pretty much a mixed bag. Dragons Units dealing increased damage is always useful but Armored and Qi Adepts only having a rather low chance of Breaking their target isn't worth relying on. Mystical Units dealing extra damamge based on their magic sounds good in theory but is let down by how there are only two Mystical Class that can use Swords and both are locked to a specific character. So other Mystical Units will need to use Sigurd's Engage Weapons for Override, all of which are Physical Weapons and Mystical Units don't exactly have the best Strength Stats. So their base damage with Override will likely be rather poor. <br><br>

Like Marth's Lodestar Rush, if you want to get the most mileage out of Override you'll want to remember two things. <br><br>

1) Override is boosted by Momentum, so the further Sigurd moves, the more damage Override will do. <br>
2) Use a forged Smash Weapon like a Steel or Silver Greatlance because you won't have to worry about accuracy or being counterattacked. <br><br>

However, if you want to a more magical approach, you could consider using Override with a Mage Knight or Griffin Knight equipped with a Levin Sword. Also like Lodestar Rush, Override is also subject to the "<b>Rush Effect</b>" but in this context, it has a chance of trigger on every enemy hit by Override.

## Engage Weapons 

| **Bond Lv.** | **Name** | **Might** | **Hit** | **Crit** | **Weight** | **Range** | **Effect** |
| l | ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/sigurd/SigurdRidersbaneFE17Sprite.webp) <br> **Ridersbane** | 10 | 75 | 0 | 6 | 1 | Effective: Cavalry|
| l0 | ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/sigurd/SigurdBraveLanceFE17Sprite.webp) <br> **Brave Lance** | 7 | 60 | 0 | 12 | 1 | If user initiates combat, attacks twice |

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

The <b>Ridersbane</b> is definitely the most fun of Sigurd's Engage weapons to play around with because against Cavalry Foes, it effectively has 30 Might. Combine this with Momentum, boosted by Gallop and you have an easy way to wipe Cavalry Foes off the map. Recall how I said Override could be comical when used on a line of Cavalry Foes. The Ridersbane is why. I've seen people in the Engage online communities call this the "Ridersbane Shishkebab" and it fits. <br><br>

The <b>Brave Lance</b> is an Engage Weapon I'm not too fond of. Low Might and low Accuracy isn't a fair trade off for the Brave Effect of attacking twice. It's also rather heavy so not many units, even with Sigurd's passive Build bonus, can reliably double attack with it. Recall how Momentum only applies to the first hit of an attack. That applies to the Brave Lance, even if you are quadruple attacking. If the first hit of the Brave Lance misses, that's it. The other 3 hits don't get the bonus from Momentum.

|9 |Sword Proficiency <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/swordprof.PNG) |Proficiency with Swords. Required for promotion to certain classes |Auto |

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

When it comes to Skill Inheritance, <b>Canter</b> is the prize here and it's no contest. It's a skill that every unit in the game can some use for. 1000 SP isn't that much to ask for such a useful skill. <br><br>

I've already said what I needed about <b>Headlong Rush</b>. Even after Chapter 11, it is still a useful skill to have and is dirt cheap to inherit. <br><br>

I don't recommend inheriting <b>Momentum</b> on Foot units as their movement upon promotion caps out a 5 which isn't enough to ake Momentum worth it, especially when Canter costs the same. If I had a choice between the two, I'd go with Canter. <br><br>

Sigurd's Stat Skill is <b>Hit+</b>. These Skills have the most universal appeal as in Engage, you'll often being dealing with shaky hit rates (79% and under), either from characters having subpar DEX stats, weapons with shaky accuracy rates, or from fighting speedy enemies like Swordmasters or Griffin Knights. Having a flat bonus to your accuracy rates can be useful. <br><br>

Sigurd's Weapon Skill is the <b>Lance Power</b> line of Skills. Unfortunately, compared to the Hit+ Skills, I can't recommend these skills are not only are they niche but expensive. However, if you want to inherit these skills, I recommend them on Lance Users like Knights, Generals, or Great Knights. They usually have such high DEF stats that they don't need to worry about dodging so the Avoid penalty is meaningless to them in exchange for hitting harder. <br><br>

Lastly, Sigurd gives both <b>Lance Proficiency</b> and <b>Sword Proficiency</b>.

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

At higher bond levels, 2 of Sigurd's Sync Skills get upgrades. <b>Canter+</b> is pretty good with 3 spaces instead of 2. But <b>Momentum+</b> I find odd as the only thing that changes is the removal of the limit on the extra damage it grants. This is great, especially if you're using a Cavalry Unit with Sigurd as that's +14 extra damage from Momentum if you're moving as far as you can go.

## Engage Weapons 

| **Bond Lv.** | **Name** | **Might** | **Hit** | **Crit** | **Weight** | **Range** | **Effect** |
| l5 | ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/sigurd/TyrfingFE17Sprite.webp) <br> **Tyrfing** |15  |80  |0  |7  |1  |Grants RES+5 |

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

Sigurd's final Engage Weapon is his iconic Holy Weapon from his home game <b>Tyrfing</b>. Statwise, it's pretty good across the board and that added RES can make Sigurd's user into a decent Mage-Killer if need be. <br><br>

However, if there's one criticism I have about Tyrfing is that if you've played Sigurd's home game, you'll see this weapon got a massive downgrade from the <b>30 Might, +10 DEX, +10 SPD, and +20 RES</b>. No I am not joking, those are its original stats in its home game. Genealogy was absolutely WILD with how powerful its Holy Weapons were and Tyrfing is one of the more tame examples.

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

Nothing much to say about Sigurd's higher level Inheritance. <b>Momentum+</b> is still not worth inheriting most of the time. If I had 2000 SP, I'd rather inherit <b>Canter+</b> though most of the time I find regular Canter to be good enough for most units.

</details>




# **Character Builds**
When it comes to builds with Sigurd, I usually go with the following ideas.

<details>
<summary> Lance Override </summary>
This involves putting Sigurd on a powerful Lancer user, preferably a <b>Lance Cavalry Unit</b> to reap the full benefits of Gallop and Override as most promoted Lance Cavalry Classes have a high enough Lance Rank to use a Steel Greatlance for high Override Damage.

</details>

<details>
<summary> Mobile Fortress </summary>

This involves putting Sigurd on an Armoured Unit like a <b>Knight</b> or <b>General</b> and turning them into a mobile fortress. While Armored Units don't receive any special bonuses from Sigurd, they greatly appreciate the extra mobility he provides. This build is good in the Early Game, especially if you inherit one of Sigurd's Hit+ skills to patch up their questionable Hit rates. However, be careful you don't send your Knight/General too far ahead into the range of enemy Mages as Armored Units' RES are so low that not even the RES bonus from Tyrfing will help much. It also doesn't help that mages have a good chance of doubling Armored Units.

</details>


<details>
<summary> Sandstorm </summary>

In Engage, the Character <b>Timerra</b> has a unique Class called Picket. This class's unique skill; Sandstorm has a chance to use her high DEF stat in damage calculation instead of her usually lower STR stat. Sandstorm stacks with Momentum to amp up her damage. Furthermore, when Timerra uses Override, she has a chance of triggering Sandstorm on EACH enemy hit by the Engage Attack and it's pretty funny when it procs on most of them.  

</details>




# **Final Thoughts** <br>

I don't have much left to say about Sigurd as he's pretty simple. He's all about letting and you move crazy amounts of distance in a single turn and his Sync Skills encourage this mindset. If you ever have a unit that you need halfway across the map, Sigurd can get them there in record speed.
