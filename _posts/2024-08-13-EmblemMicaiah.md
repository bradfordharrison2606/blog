# **Introduction**
Micaiah represents the 2nd Game of the Tellius Duology: Radiant Dawn. Unlike the previous 5 Emblems, she is all about being a Support and Utility Unit focused on Staves. Now this might sound lame but trust me, Micaiah is often considered one of the strongest Emblems in the entire game, including DLC Emblems. 

# **Initial Gameplay (Bond 1 - 10)** 

## Stat Bonuses

| **Bond Lv.** | **MAG** | **RES** | **LUCK** |
|1  | +1 | +2 | +2 |
|2  | +2 | +2 | +2 |
|4  | +2 | +3 | +2 |
|8  | +2 | +3 | +4 |

Wearing Micaiah's Ring grants boosts to Magic, Resistance, and Luck. The Magic boost may give the impression that you could run Micaiah on offenses Mages but Celica gives a bigger raw Magic boost than her at equivalent Bond Levels.

## Sync Skills


| **Sync Skill** | **Bond Lv** | **Effect** |
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/micaiah/FE17_Cleric_Icon.webp) <br> Cleric |1  |Unit can equip staves up to Rank C.  | 
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/micaiah/FE17_Healing_Light_Icon.webp) <br> **Healing Light** | 3 |When unit heals an ally with a staff, unit also recovers HP=50% of the amount healed.  |

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

<b>Cleric</b> is Micaiah's trademark Sync Skill in the same vein as Marth's Perceptive and Roy's Hold Out. However, the major difference here is that Cleric is NOT inheritable (hence why it isn't bolded), and for good reason. The ability for any Unit regardless of Class to use Staves would be incredibly broken on certain units. Now that Rank C limitation might sound like a letdown but the number of Staves in Engage at Rank C and below is quite a lot, including useful Staves like <b>Obstruct, Restore, Rewarp, Physic, Freeze, and Silence</b>. This is especially useful on Alear as they have access to the Convoy mid-battle and thus can pull out Staves to either assist your allies or hinder your enemies. Cleric means that even at Bond 1, Micaiah turns her wearer into a versatile Staff User and a lot of characters in Engage who aren't dedicated Mages have decent Magic Stats and Growths. <br><br>

<b>Healing Light</b> solves the long-standing issue in Fire Emblem where Staff Users not being able to heal themselves. I recommend spreading this skill around to your primary and even secondary Healers so they don't have to worry about keeping their HP topped off. This is also useful on Qi-Adepts Staff Class like Martial Monk/Master as their Chain Guard ability requires them to be at full HP. <br><br>

Lastly, we have <b>Silence Ward</b> which is simple but effective. Silence like in many RPGs prevents anyone afflicted from using magic or staves which can be quite a pain if one of your Mages or Healers is affected by it. Definitely try and spread this around to your dedicated Mages and Healers so they don't have to worry about being locked out of the fight for a couple of turns.

## Engage Skill

| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/micaiah/FE17_Augment_Icon.webp) <br> **Augment** |Grants staff range +5 and Area of Effect +1. |


|**Unit Type**|**Bonus**|
|Dragon|Additional Staff Range+1 |
|Qi Adept|+20% HP healed by Staves |

<details>
<summary> Explanation (AKA: Why Micaiah is considered the strongest Emblem) </summary>

Micaiah's Engage Form is one of the best in the game and <b>Augment</b> is only one of two reasons it is. What this skill means when it says Staves have "area-of-effect+1" is that staves now affect a cross/plus-shaped area, allowing healing staves to have an AOE effect for healing multiple units. The Range+5 means that normal staves like Heal and Mend become Physic and it increases the range of Staves like Physic. <br><br>

However, Augment isn't limited to healing staves, it works on ALL staves. So you can have AOE versions of debilitating staves like Silence, Freeze, Entrap, and Obstruct at extended ranges. <b>Augmented Entrap</b> is especially great as it allows you to pull up to 5 enemies out of position, breaking their formation and making it easier for your army to kill them because they'll be separated from their allies. But the fun doesn't stop there, we're just getting started. <br><br>

Augment is at its most powerful (read: broken) when paired with mobility staves like <b>Warp, Rewarp, and Rescue</b>. With these staves, you can teleport up to 5 members of your army halfway across the map. When you get the Dancer of this game, you can have them refresh Micaiah's user and have them use Augmented Rescue to teleport 5 more members of your army toward the others. <br><br>

I cannot stress how insanely powerful this is. The ability to teleport your entire army across the map in a single turn can trivialize some chapters, especially if you know what you're doing. The only downside of Augment is that you can only use it for 3/4 Turns at a time. <br><br>

I'm not going to say much about the Class Bonuses because when the base effect of a Skill is this good, who needs them?

## Engage Attack

| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/micaiah/FE17_Great_Sacrifice_Icon.webp) <br> **Great Sacrifice** | Use to restore full HP to all allies and NPC units. After use, User's HP reduced to 1. |

|**Unit Type**|**Bonus**|
|Dragon| HP reduced to 30% of current HP |
|Armored |Grants DEF+1 to all allies during their next combat |
|Qi Adept |Also cures Status |


<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

<b>Great Sacrifice (GS)</b> continues the trend of proving Support abilities can be completely broken. A full heal that covers the entire map for both your allies and NPCs (Green Units) would be good enough. That penalty of reducing the user's HP to 1 isn't that much of a danger because you'll likely use GS out of range from enemies who could finish you off and Micaiah's wearer has Healing Light to get them healthy again. However, the other awesome thing about GS is that it gives <b>A LOT OF EXPERIENCE</b>.<br><br>

How GS works is that it calculates the EXP gained based on how many units were healed by it. If your entire army was healed by GS, no matter how little the amount, that's basically a free Level Up. Engage is a game that discourages level grinding through various means but GS is one of the few ways of grinding in this game. Stick Micaiah on a low-level unit and watch their level skyrocket as they use GS.<br><br>

Like Augment, the Unit Bonuses aren't worth talking about that much because the base effect and EXP gain of GS is just that good.

## Engage Weapons 

| **Bond Lv.** | **Name** | **Might** | **Hit** | **Crit** | **Weight** | **Range** | **Effect** |
| l | ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/micaiah/ShineFE17Sprite.webp) <br> **Shine** |7  |90  |10  |5  |1-2  |Illuminates a 5-space radius in Fog of War (shrinks one space per turn) |
| l0 | ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/micaiah/NosferatuFE17Sprite.webp) <br> **Nosferatu** |9  |85  |0  |7  |1-2  |Restores HP=50% of Damage Dealt |

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

<b>Shine</b> is basically an Illume/Torch in weapon form. It lights up a 5-space diamond-shaped area in Fog of War. In Fire Emblem, Fog of War is a mechanic that covers the battlefield in darkness where the only thing you can see is the terrain and not the enemies. Having the ability to light up this darkness at will sounds nice but the issue with Shine is that Fog of War Maps are rare in Engage. There are only 3 in the Main Story (one of which Micaiah is unavailable) and FoW Skirmishes are random. Other than that it has decent stats.<br><br>

<b>Nosferatu</b> simply drains the enemy of their HP which can be nice as a way of getting Micaiah's wearer healthy after using Great Sacrifice. However, if you (somehow) managed to inherit Hold Out from Roy, Nosteratu is a good way to keep your unit above the HP threshold required for it to activate. <br><br>

While Micaiah's Engage Weapons aren't bad by any means, Micaiah is designed to be a support unit, not a combat unit. A turn you spend attacking with Micaiah's Engage Weapons is a turn you're not spending using Augment or Great Sacrifice.

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

Contrasting Emblems whose Skill Inheritance was some mix of dirt cheap and stupidly expensive (especially Roy) Micaiah's Skill Inheritance is dirt cheap across the board. As stated before, Cleric is not inheritable. <br><br>

<b>Silence Ward</b> and <b>Healing Light</b> are especially useful for your dedicated magic users. While you might not have the room to always have these equipped, it's always nice to have the option based on the current map. I recommend having Silence Ward on your main staff user so they will always be able use Restore to cure your other magic users of Silence. <br><br>

Micaiah's Weapon Skill <b>Staff Mastery</b> might sound odd but that Hit+ bonus affects status staves (Silence, Fracture, etc) which have hit rates. These skills combined with another inheritable skill from a later Emblem, can ensure your status staves almost never miss. If you want to combine Micaiah's Augment with Status Staves, I recommend inheriting a Staff Mastery Skill onto them to boost your chances of success as that Hit+10/15 goes a long way. <br><br>

Her Stat Skill <b>Resistance+</b> might seem like a way to patch up Armored Unit's main weakness to Magic but that's more impractical than it seems as Armored Units have such low Resistance combined with low Speed that Mages routinely double them which would render any boost to Resistance pointless. <br><br>

For Proficiencies, Micaiah gives 3, a rarity for any (Non-DLC) Emblem not named Leif. She grants <b>Staves, Knives, and Tomes</b>. Micaiah and Leif are the only two Base Game Emblems to grant Staff Proficiency and Micaiah gives it much earlier at Bond 3 compared to Leif at Bond 6 so Micaiah is the cheaper option to get this from. Tome Proficiency is nice but you can get it earlier from Celica. Knife Proficiency might seem out of place as Micaiah isn't even a physical-based Emblem but it's a reference to her home game where 1) Knives were their own separate Weapon Type and 2) Her closest confidant Sothe used Knives as his primary weapon.

# **Post Paralogue Gameplay (Bond 11 - 20)** 

## Stat Bonuses

| **Bond Lv.** | **MAG** | **RES** | **LUCK** |
|12  | +3 | +3 | +4 |
|14  | +3 | +4 | +4 |
|16  | +3 | +4 | +6 |
|17  | +4 | +4 | +6 |
|19  | +4 | +5 | +6 |

Micaiah's Stat Bonuses cap out respectable numbers. That boost to Luck is noteworthy as if you're using Staff Mastery combined with a certain Sync Skill, that extra Luck goes a long way. 


## Sync Skills

| **Sync Skill** | **Bond Lv** | **Effect** |
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/micaiah/FE17_Cleric2B_Icon.webp) <br> Cleric+ |13  |Unit can equip staves up to Rank B.  | 
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/micaiah/FE17_Cleric3B_Icon.webp) <br> Cleric++ |18  |Unit can equip staves up to Rank A.  | 

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

Like Roy and his Hold Out, Micaiah only gets upgrades to her signature skill at higher bond levels. <b>Cleric+</b> enables non-Staff focused units to have a Staff Rank high enough to use Warp, Rewarp, and Rescue combined with Augment for mass teleportation shenanigans. <b>Cleric++</b> allows any Unit at Bond 18 with Micaiah to use EVERY Staff in the game except the S-Rank one. Do remember that Cleric+ and Cleric++ cannot be inherited. They are exclusive to Micaiah and her current wearer.

## Engage Weapons 

| **Bond Lv.** | **Name** | **Might** | **Hit** | **Crit** | **Weight** | **Range** | **Effect** |
| l5 | ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/micaiah/ThaniFE17Sprite.webp) <br> **Thani** |11  |100  |0  |6  |1-2  |Effective: Cavalry, Armored. |


<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

Alas, we come to one of my favorite Weapons in all of Fire Emblem. The <b>Tactical Horse and Armor Nuking Incantation</b>. Codenamed: <b>Thani</b>. It has decent stats across the board and while it's a bit weaker than Celica's Ragnarok, it is nowhere near as heavy so most units won't have trouble doubling with this. The Armored Effective is incredibly useful as I've stated before, Armored Units in Engage have horrendous Resistance stats, making Magic their main weakness. So having a tome that effectively has <b>33 Might</b> against them means that like in Micaiah's home game, Armored Units aren't surviving 2 hits from this thing. While I recommend using Micaiah primarily as a support unit, if there's an Armored Enemy that no one else can kill, then give a good dose of Thani to wipe them off the map.

## Skill Inheritance

| **Bond Lv.** | **Skill** | **Effect** | **SP Cost** |
|11 | Strong Bond <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/skillinherit.webp)| Unit stays engaged 1 additional turns (4 Turns) |Auto |
|12 |Staff Mastery 3 <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/micaiah/FE17_Staff_Mastery_3_Icon.webp) |Grants Hit+20 when using a staff. Staves also heal an additional 7 HP. |500 |
|14 |Resistance+4 <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/micaiah/FE17_Resistance_2B4_Icon.webp) |Grants Resistance +4 |1000 |
|16 |Staff Mastery 4 <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/micaiah/FE17_Staff_Mastery_4_Icon.webp) |Grants Hit+25 when using a staff. Staves also heal an additional 10 HP. |500 |
|17 |Staff Mastery 5 <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/micaiah/FE17_Staff_Mastery_5_Icon.webp) |Grants Hit+30 when using a staff. Staves also heal an additional 15 HP. |1000 |
|19 |Resistance+5 <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/micaiah/FE17_Resistance_2B5_Icon.webp) |Grants Resistance +5 |2000 |
|20 | Deep Synergy <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/skillinherit.webp)| Unit's Engage Meter is shortened by one (1) step |Auto |

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

There isn't much to Micaiah's higher-level inheritance as it's pretty lacklustre, mainly because Cleric and its upgrades are not inheritable. The only skills worth anything here are the higher levels of Staff Mastery which are pretty reasonably priced as that +15 HP bonus to healing can turn even mediocre healers into great ones. Despite this, I still recommend completing Micaiah's Paralogue, even if the prize isn't all that great.

</details>




# **Character Builds**
Micaiah has 3 use cases, all focused on exploiting her sheer Staff Utility. 

<details>
<summary> Experience Grinding </summary>
    Micaiah is one of the few ways to level grind in Engage and that's via spamming Great Sacrifice. If you want to get the most mileage out of this, you are going to need help from two other Emblems you receive later in the game. The Emblem from the Ring of the Crux of Fate lets you create Fire tiles which damage your allies so Micaiah's user can heal them for free EXP. The Emblem from the Ring of the Instructor has a Sync Skill that boosts the EXP gained by adjacent allies. 


</details>

<details>
<summary> Extra Staff User </summary>

If you're on a Map with limited deployment slots and need an additional healer, it may be worth considering putting Micaiah on someone. Even at Bond 1, Cleric will still allow them access to most healing staves. My personal favorite way of doing this is putting Micaiah on a Mage Knight or Griffin Knights since they have great combat ability so adding Micaiah's Staff Utlity on top of that makes for a versatile unit. 

</details>

<details>
<summary> Staff God </summary>
If you want to go all in on Micaiah's Staff Utility, I'd recommend using her on Classes who already wield staves naturally. Most Staff wielding classes in Engage (with the exception of Griffin Knights and Royal Knights) have a default Staff Rank of at least B. This means even at Bond 1, they can still perform most of the tricks with Augment such as mass teleportation. Staff users in Engage are already incredibly useful but Micaiah elevates them to God Status. 


</details>


# **Final Thoughts** <br>
Micaiah is an Emblem that proves Staff and Support-related abilities can be just as, if not more valuable than raw combat abilities. She enables some truly disgusting strategies through her augmented staff abilities. She's probably the reason the game doesn't hand you staves like Warp, Rescue, and Entrap on a silver platter. 

Combat-wise, Micaiah isn't bad by any means, it's just that her support abilities eclipse them in usefulness. I don't blame you if you forget Micaiah even has Engage Weapons. **Basically, if you're using Micaiah for combat, you're using her wrong**.
