# **Introduction**
Corrin represents the 2nd of the 3DS Fire Emblem Games: Fates. On first impression, Corrin is a ... peculiar Emblem whose role is often misunderstood by uninformed players. However, once you dissect her kit you realize that she is an Emblem designed to make life miserable for the enemy through debilitating debuffs and altering the terrain of the battlefield.

## Sync Skills - Dragon Vein

| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/corrin/FE17_Dragon_Vein_Icon.webp) <br> Dragon Vein | 1 | Use to add a special effect to certain spaces.

I'm giving Dragon Vein its own section because it is a bit complicated to explain. Dragon Vein allows you to create unique terrain effects. Before I go any further, I need to make one thing clear. Terrain effects created through Dragon Vein **DO NOT DISCRIMINATE**! What I mean is that the terrain you create affects both sides equally. The positive effects can help the enemy and the negative effects can harm you, The Player. So please remember this when using Dragon Vein. What makes Dragon Vein unique among Sync Skills is that it's basically a mini Engage Skill as every Unit type in the game produces a different kind of Terrain. The following section details the different Veins granted to the different classes.

<summary> Explanation </summary>

Of Corrin's Dragon Vein effects I want to draw attention to a specific few. <br><br> 

<b>Covert Units</b> get the most "braindead" effect as they get the Avoid bonus from the fog tiles doubled. In the early days of Engage, this made players put Corrin on Thieves and call it a day. <br><br>

<b>Armored Units</b> can share their immunity to Break with their allies which can be great if you want to tank on Enemy Phase without worrying about being Broken. <br><br>

My personal favorite of Corrin's Veins is the flames created by <b>Mystical Units</b>. These are the same kind of flames created by Roy's Blazing Lion except you always have access to them. Flame Tiles are great for slowing down and keeping dangerous enemies at bay, all while damaging them. If a horde of enemies is heading your way, just lay down some of Corrin's flames to buy you a turn or two to prepare for them. <br><br>

However, if you can't pick just one, you don't have to because Dragons get access to ALL of Corrin's Dragon Vein options. If you decide to keep Alear in their Dragon Child/Divine Dragon Class, Corrin makes them an even better Support Unit.

## Sync Skills

| **Sync Skill** | **Bond Lv** | **Effect** |
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/corrin/FE17_Quality_Time_Icon.webp) <br> **Quality Time** | 3 | After unit acts or waits, restores 5 HP to adjacent allies and slightly increases support with them. | 
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/corrin/FE17_Draconic_Hex_Icon.webp) <br> **Draconic Hex** | 8 | If unit initiates combat, inflicts -4 to all of foeâ€™s basic stats after combat. <br> (Penalties shrink by 1 each turn.) |

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

While not as versatile as Dragon Vein, Corrin's other Sync Skills still bring value to the table. <br><br>

<b>Quality Time</b> can be great for keeping your army topped on HP. I like to combine this Sync Skill with Sigurd's Canter as it can put you in a better position to heal allies after acting. <br><br>

Corrin's best Sync Skill bar none is <b>Draconic Hex</b>. Inflicting -4 on an enemy's basic stats (Strength, Magic, Dexterity, Speed, Luck, Defence, Resistance) can absolutely cripple enemies and especially bosses. While the stat debuff decreases by 1 every turn, usually the enemy will be long dead before you ever need to worry about that. <br><br>

The best part about Draconic Hex is that your attack doesn't even need to deal damage or land. All you have to do is initiate combat and Draconic Hex will trigger. All of this makes Draconic Hex one of my personal favorite Sync Skills in the entire game. 

</details>
 
## Engage Skill

| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/corrin/FE17_Dreadful_Aura_Icon.webp) <br> **Dreadful Aura** | If unit initiates combat, target foe and all foes within 1 space of it cannot move for 1 turn after combat. |

|**Unit Type**|**Bonus**|
|Covert| Also Avoid-20 |

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

Corrin's role as a Debuffer is further emphasized with her Engage Skill <b>Dreadful Aura</b>. This Engage Skill allows Corrin's User to inflict Freeze not just on a single enemy but any enemies adjacent to them. Not only will the enemy be stopped dead in their tracks but also inflict stat debuffs on them via Draconix Hex. <br><br>

If you're about to fight a boss, it's a good idea to have Corrin's User Engage and attack them first to get the debuffs onto them before the rest of your army attacks. If you want to push Dreadful Aura to its limits, it is best combined with Corrin's Engage Attack. <br><br>

<b>Fun Fact</b>: Dreadful Aura is the only Engage Skill in the game (Aside from Sacred Twins) to not grant a bonus to Dragon Units but grant bonuses to other Unit types. 

</details>

## Engage Attack

| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/corrin/FE17_Torrential_Roar_Icon.webp) <br> **Torrential Roar**  | Use to attack 3 spaces in a line, turning those spaces into water terrain. |


|**Unit Type**|**Bonus**|
|Dragon| Range+1 (4 Spaces in a line) |


<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

<b>Torrential Roar</b> (Again, thanks Smash Bros.) is like Sigurd's Override as it attacks all enemies in a straight line with an upper limit of 4 spaces. This Engage Attack usually won't skill or even decently damage anything it hits but that's not the point. You're not using Torrential Roar for the damage, you're using it for the debuffs. Assuming you're at least Bond 8 with Corrin you'll get the effects of Draconic Hex to debuff up to 4 enemies and Dreadful Aura to freeze not only the enemies hit by the attack but all the enemies adjacent to those 4 enemies. The cherry on top is the water terrain left behind which inflicts an avoid penalty that the enemies can't negate because they will be frozen. <br><br>

One of the biggest perks of Torrential Roar is that the water terrain it leaves behind <b>OVERRIDES</b> the effects of the terrain previously there. For example, say a Boss is on a protective tile that provides +30 Avoid. If you use Torrential Roar to add water terrain to that tile, the water's -30 Avoid will cancel out the +30 Avoid granted by the more protective tile. <br><br>

Corrin's kit up to this point has been amazing and if you've been noticing a trend with the Emblems, if they have great Sync Skills and Engage abilities, then there is a good chance their Engage Weapons are their main drawback and unfortunately, Corrin is no different.

## Engage Weapons 

| **Bond Lv.** | **Name** | **Might** | **Hit** | **Crit** | **Weight** | **Range** | **Effect** |
| l | ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/corrin/DualKatanaFE17Sprite.webp) <br> **Dual Katana** | 8 | 75 | 5 | 7 | 1 | Grants advantage vs. lances but disadvantage vs. axes. |
| l0 | ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/corrin/WakizashiFE17Sprite.webp) <br> **Wakizashi** | 10 | 75 | 0 | 10 | 2 |Avoid -10 |
| - | ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/corrin/DragonFangFE17Sprite.webp) <br> **Dragon Fang** | 20 | 100 | 0 | 7 | 1 | Only used during Engage Attack. |

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

Corrin is widely considered to have some of the worst Engage Weapons in the game. While nothing can beat Leif and his Master Lance, Corrin's Engage Weapons are still pretty terrible. <br><br>

The <b>Dual Katana</b> is a reskin of Roy's Lancereaver except it has worse stats in everything except Critical Rate and Weight. <br><br>

The <b>Wakizashi</b> is an oddball. It can hit enemies at range but unlike the Light Brand, Binding Blade, and Ragnell, it is ONLY usable at 2 Range. This means that this Engage Weapon is completely useless in melee combat. It also doesn't help that it inflicts an Avoid penalty while equipped. <br><br>

<b>Dragon Fang</b> is in the same boat at Leif's Master Bow and the Azure Twins' Siegmund as it's only usable during Corrin's Engage Attack. Despite the flashy water animation, the game classifies Dragon Fang as a Physical Weapon for the purposes of damage calculation.

## Skill Inheritance 

| **Bond Lv.** | **Skill** | **Effect** | **SP Cost** |
| 1|HP+5 <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/corrin/FE17_HP_2B5_Icon.webp) |Grants Max HP+5 | 300|
| 2|HP+7 <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/corrin/FE17_HP_2B7_Icon.webp) |Grants Max HP+7 |500 |

| 4|Sword Focus 1 <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/corrin/FE17_Sword_Focus_1_Icon.webp) | Grants Hit+10 at a cost of Ddg-10 when using a sword.| 100 |
|5 |Skill Inheritance <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/skillinherit.webp) |Unit can inherit this Emblem's Skills |Auto |
|6 |Sword Proficiency <br> ![pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/swordprof.png) |Proficiency with Swords. Required for Promotion/Reclassing to certain Classes |Auto |
| 7|Sword Focus 2 <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/corrin/FE17_Sword_Focus_2_Icon.webp) |Grants Hit+15 at a cost of Ddg-10 when using a sword.	 | 300 |
| 8|Draconic Hex <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/corrin/FE17_Draconic_Hex_Icon.webp) |If unit initiates combat, inflicts -4 to all of foeâ€™s basic stats after combat. <br> (Penalties shrink by 1 each turn.) | 2000|
| 9|HP+10 <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/corrin/FE17_HP_2B10_Icon.webp) |Grants Max HP+10 | 1000 |

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

Since Dragon Vein isn't inheritable, Corrin's Inheritance is a bit on the lighter side. <br>

<b>Draconic Hex</b> is the main prize here and 2000 SP is more than worth it for how much it can cripple bosses. A gimmicky build is giving this skill to your main Lyn User and having them combine it with Astra Storm to inflict Debuffs from 10 spaces away. <br><br> 

Corrin's Stat Skill is <b>HP+</b> and they give you a lot of HP relative to their SP cost. The only major weakness of the HP+ skills is that more HP means that enemy Chain Attacks are going to hurt more. <br><br> 

The same can't be said for her Weapon Skill <b>Sword Focus</b>. This skill isn't that great because Swords usually have high Hit Rates and most Sword Users have good DEX stats to ensure they rarely miss. <br><br>

The only Weapon Proficiency she grants is <b>Sword Proficiency</b> which is nothing new as plenty of other Emblems already provide this Proficiency. This is a real shame because, in her home game, she could be promoted into classes that also use Tomes or Staves depending on your choices. 

</details>



# **Post Paralogue Gameplay (Bond 11 - 20)** 

## Stat Bonuses

| **Bond Lv.** | **HP** | **MAG** | **RES** |
| 12 | +10 | +3 | +2 |
| 14 | +10 | +3 | +3 |
| 16 | +12 | +3 | +3 |
| 17 | +12 | +4 | +3 |
| 19 | +15 | +4 | +3 |

At higher Bond Levels, Corrin's boost to HP becomes hilariously huge. They're so big that they can give even your more fragile units some decent bulk.

## Sync Skills

| **Sync Skill** | **Bond Lv** | **Effect** |
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/corrin/FE17_Pair_Up_Icon.webp) <br> **Pair Up** | 13 |Prevents damage from foesâ€™ Chain Attacks against unit. <br> (Enemy Chain Attacks deal 0 Damage)  | 
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/corrin/FE17_Quality_Time2B_Icon.webp) <br> **Quality Time+** | 18 | After unit acts or waits, restores 10 HP to adjacent allies and slightly increases support with them. |


<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>
Corrin's final Sync Skill <b>Pair Up</b> is incredibly useful but not for reasons you might think. On her main user, it's very useful, especially on Tanks when combined with her massive passive boosts to HP. However, its real purpose is to be inherited by your main Ike User. Recall in Ike's Profile where I said his main weakness is Chain Attacks and you would get a way to patch up this weakness. Well, here you go. <br><br>

<b>Quality Time+</b> is just an upgraded version of Quality Time. It's useful on Corrin's Main User but getting someone else all the way to Bond 18 with Corrin for this skill usually isn't worth it.


</details>


## Engage Weapons 

| **Bond Lv.** | **Name** | **Might** | **Hit** | **Crit** | **Weight** | **Range** | **Effect** |
| l5 | ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/corrin/YatoFE17Sprite.webp) <br> **Yato** | 16 | 85 | 10 | 9 | 1 | Avoid+10, Critival Avoid+10|

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

Surprising no one, Corrin's final Engage Weapon is her iconic sword, <b>Yato</b> (Just the plain version, not the Omega Yato). By Bond 15 Weapon standards it's pretty middle of the road. It has decent stats all around but it lacks the 1-2 Range of other weapons and its passive bonus effects aren't anything special. Maybe if it had Stat Bonuses or Effectiveness it would be better. However, this doesn't matter as Corrin is better off debuffing than dealing damage. 

</details>


## Skill Inheritance

| **Bond Lv.** | **Skill** | **Effect** | **SP Cost** |
|11 | Strong Bond <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/skillinherit.webp)| Unit stays engaged 1 additional turns (4 Turns) |Auto |
|12 |Sword Focus 3 <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/corrin/FE17_Sword_Focus_3_Icon.webp) |Grants Hit+20 at a cost of Ddg-10 when using a sword. | 500|
|13 |Pair Up <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/corrin/FE17_Pair_Up_Icon.webp) |Prevents damage from foesâ€™ Chain Attacks against unit. <br> (Enemy Chain Attacks deal 0 Damage) | 2000 |
|14 |Sword Focus 4 <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/corrin/FE17_Sword_Focus_4_Icon.webp) | Grants Hit+25 at a cost of Ddg-10 when using a sword.| 700 |
|16 |HP+12 <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/corrin/FE17_HP_2B12_Icon.webp) | Grants Max HP+12|2000 |
|17 |Sword Focus 5 <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/corrin/FE17_Sword_Focus_5_Icon.webp) |Grants Hit+30 at a cost of Ddg-10 when using a sword. | 1000|
|18 |Quality Time+ <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/corrin/FE17_Quality_Time2B_Icon.webp) |After unit acts or waits, restores 10 HP to adjacent allies and slightly increases support with them. |500 |
|19 |HP+15 <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/corrin/FE17_HP_2B15_Icon.webp) |Grants Max HP+15 |500 |
|20 | Deep Synergy <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/skillinherit.webp)| Unit's Engage Meter is shortened by one (1) step |Auto |

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

Corrin's higher-level Inheritance isn't anything to write home about. It's just better versions of HP+ and Sword Focus along with Quality Time+. However, stacking HP+15 onto Corrin's already huge boost to HP can lead to Corrin's Users having hilariously inflated HP values. <br><br>

If you want to inherit <b>Pair Up</b>, it's best used on Tank units (like Ike) or units that see a lot of Enemy Phase combat. Enemy Chain Attacks can chip away at your units surprisingly fast and having a way to block them adds a lot of bulk to your units. If you can only put Pair Up on one other unit, make sure it's Ike's User as once they have Pair Up, they become nigh unkillable.

# **Character Builds**

<details>
<summary> Divine Dragon Vein Alear. </summary>
Unlike most other Lords in Fire Emblem, Alear is more of a support unit than a combat powerhouse which makes them great for Corrin. If you're planning on keeping Alear in their Dragon Child/Divine Dragon Class, then Corrin makes a fantastic Emblem for them. <br><br>

With this build, Alear will have full access to every single Dragon Vein Corrin has to offer. This adds a lot of versatility and flexibility to Alear as you can pick and choose which Dragon Vein is ideal for the current situation. <br><br>

Also, since Alear is a support unit, having them attack a boss first with Torrential Roar, opens up the rest of your army to go to town on them. 


</details>


<details>
<summary> Mystical Wildfire</summary>

This is my personal favorite way of running Corrin. I already explained how good the Flame tiles Mystical Units can create with Dragon Vein but it doesn't stop there. <br><br>

Most Mystical Units can wield Thunder Tomes which can attack from 3 spaces away. This allows you to inflict Draconic Hex and Dreadful Aura on enemies from a safe distance. Thunder Tomes can be inaccurate but remember that you don't need to land an attack or deal damage to inflict Corrin's debuffs. <br><br>

If you're going for this build, I recommend Corrin on my supportive Mystical Units like <b>High Priest</b> as they can also provide Staff Utility to supplement the abilities Corrin grants them.

</details>

<details>
<summary> Fog and Dagger </summary>

This is a build that was ubiquitous when Engage first launched. When <b>Covert Units</b> use Dragon Vein to create Fog, they get the avoid bonus from the Fog Tiles doubled which increases their dodge tanking capabilities. <br><br>

In particular, the character <b>Yunaka</b> is the primary candidate for this build. Not only is she a Thief by default, but her Personal Skill gives her a boosted Critical Rate whenever she is standing in terrain with an Avoid bonus, such as Corrin's Fog. <br><br>

The problem with this build is that it is very easy to get addicted to it and ignore Corrin's other Veins which could be more useful for a given chapter. 

</details>

<details>
<summary> Tank and Spank</summary>

If you want to cash in on the sheer bulk Corrin provides, then you can put Corrin on a Tank like a <b>General or Great Knight</b>. Generals provide the better Dragon Vein of the two to share their Break Immunity with their allies. Sword Focus could see use on Great Knights who use swords as their Dexterity can lack by the Endgame. Lastly, both of these classes have great Physical offenses so Torrential Roar, if it doesn't kill the enemies, will soften them up immensively for other members of your army to finish off. 

</details>

# **Final Thoughts** <br>
Corrin is a versatile Emblem that fills a unique niche among the Emblems. No other Emblem can inflict as many debuffs and debilitating effects as she can so you should make it a priority to familiarize yourself with her. On the higher difficulties where Bosses can have inflated stats, Corrin can cripple them and make it easier to kill them. You should definitely play around with Corrin's different Dragon Veins to see which ones fit your general play style. If you're going to use Ike for Great Aether, I highly recommend completing Corrin's Paralogue ASAP for access to Pair Up.
