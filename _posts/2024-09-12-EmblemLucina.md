# **Introduction**

Lucina represents the 1st of the 3DS Fire Emblems: Awakening. She is a Support Emblem like Micaiah and shows why Support Abilities can be just as powerful as combat ones. However, Lucina focuses on Chain Attacks and Chain Guard, two mechanics that when used correctly, can lead to devastating results. 

# **Initial Gameplay (Bond 1 - 10)** 

## Stat Bonuses

| **Bond Lv.** | **DEX** | **SPD** | **LUCK** |
| 1 | +1 | +1 | +2 |
| 2 | +2 | +1 | +2 |
| 4 | +2 | +2 | +2 |
| 7 | +2 | +2 | +4 |
| 9 | +3 | +2 | +4 |

Wearing the Ring of the Princess Exalt increases Dexterity, Speed, and Resistance. While it might be disappointing that she doesn't boost offensive stats like Strength or Magic, she doesn't need them as she is a Support Emblem. 


## Quick Refresher: Chain Attacks and Chain Guard



Since Lucina's gameplay heavily focused on Chain Attacks and Chain Guard, I believe a refresher on these mechanics is in order. <br>

<details>
<summary> Chain Attack </summary>

When a unit targets an enemy, ally Backup Units that are adjacent (or 2 spaces away if equipped with a Ranged Weapon) to the enemy will join in and attack the same enemy before the initiating unit attacks. Chain Attacks deal damage equal to 10% of the target's maximum HP, ignoring Defence and Resistance, and have a fixed hit rate of 80%. <br><br>

</details>


<details>
<summary> Chain Guard </summary>

This ability is exclusive to Qi Adept Classes (<b>Martial Monks/Masters, Dancers, Enchanters</b>). If a Qi Adept is at full HP, they can activate Chain Guard. During the Enemy Phase, if a unit adjacent to a Chain Guarding Qi Adept is attacked, the first attack from the enemy will be blocked by the Qi Adept Unit at the cost of 20% of their maximum HP. Once a Qi Adept has Chain Guarded an ally, they cannot do it again for the rest of the Enemy Phase. In other words, Chain Guard is once per Enemy Phase. 

</details>





## Sync Skills

| **Sync Skill** | **Bond Lv** | **Effect** |
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/lucina/FE17_Dual_Strike_Icon.webp) <br> Dual Strike | 1 | Unit participates in Chain Attacks as if it were a Backup unit. | 
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/lucina/FE17_Dual_Assist_Icon.webp) <br> **Dual Assist** | 3 | If unit is able to Chain Attack, unit will do so when allies attack foes unit could reach by moving. <br> Trigger %=35. |

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>
<b>Dual Strike</b> is Lucina's signature Sync Skill as it lets any Unit, regardless of class type Chain Attack as if they were a Backup Unit. This essentially turns Lucina's wearer into a Pseudo-Backup Unit and you can never have enough Backup Units in your party. As you might have guessed, this Sync Skill is useless on Backup Units so avoid putting Lucina on them if possible. <br><br>

<b>Dual Assist</b> patches up the biggest weakness of Backup Units and Chain Attacks. Normally to initiate a Chain Attack, a Backup Unit has to be directly adjacent to the target or 2 spaces away if have something like a Hand Axe or Javelin equipped. Dual Assist greatly expands the Chain Attack range of Backup Units. In simple terms, if a Backup has Dual Assist, ANY enemy they can reach by moving normally, is susceptible to being hit by a Chain Attack. <br><br>

I cannot stress how impactful Dual Assist is. That 35% Activation Rate might seem low but in practice, you will be surprised how often Dual Assist triggers during a Chapter. Chain Attacks are useful as they allow you to squeeze in just a little bit more damage to one round kill an enemy. This is one skill I <b>HIGHLY RECOMMEND</b> spreading this skill around to as many of your Backup Units as possible. However, remember that only Backup Units can Chain Attack so Dual Assist is useless on any non-Backup Unit. 


</details>
 
## Engage Skill

| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/lucina/FE17_Bonded_Shield_Icon.webp) <br> **Bonded Shield** | Use to prevent first attacks on adjacent allies until your next turn. <br> Trigger %=80.|


|**Unit Type**|**Bonus**|
|Dragon| Trigger% = 90%|
|Cavalry|Trigger% = 100% For Cavalry |
|Armored|Trigger% = 100% For Armored |
|Flying|Trigger% = 100% For Flying |
|Qi Adept|Trigger% = 100%|

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

I make no exaggerations when I say <b>Bonded Shield</b> is one of the best Engage Skills in the base game. This skill was heavily slept on during the initial release of Engage but nowadays, its power has been more widely recognized. <br><br> 

On paper, Bonded Shield just looks like a worse version of standard Chain Guard as Chain Guard has a 100% activation compared to Bonded Shield's 80%. However, that is until you realize that Bonded Shield lacks the 2 biggest weaknesses of Chain Guard: Bonded Shield doesn't require Lucina's User to be full HP and it isn't limited to only being once per Enemy Phase. The moment you activate it, it will stay on for the entire Enemy Phase. <br><br> 

Bonded Shield has two general use cases. <br><br> 

1) Rushing a squad of up to 4 Units into the middle of enemy lines, completely immune to damage for the entire Enemy Phase.<br><br> 

2) Baiting out dangerous foes by putting someone in their attack range and having Lucina use Bonded Shield to block their attack come the Enemy Phase. <br><br> 

Bonded Shield's biggest weakness is its 80% Activation Rate. This means that there is a 20% chance of it failing. However, that's where the Class Bonuses come in to increase the Activation Rate in specific circumstances. <br><br> 

For Cavalry, Armored, and Flying Units, their 100% Activation Rate only works for allies of the same Unit Type. So for example, if Lucina's User is a Cavalry Unit and uses Bonded Shield next to another Cavalry Ally Unit and a Backup Ally Unit, only the Cavalry Ally will have the 100% activation rate while the Backup Ally has the standard 80%. If your army is heavy on Cavalry or Flying units, it may be worth leveraging these Class Bonuses. <br><br> 

But, if you don't want to deal with all that RNG, just put Lucina on a <b>Qi Adept</b> Unit as they have a <b>100% Activation Rate for Bonded Shield for ALL unit types</b>. Qi Adepts have been getting the short end of the stick with Engage Skills but Bonded Shield more than makes up for that.<br><br> 

Lastly, please remember that Bonded Shield, though powerful, has its limitations. <br><br> 

1) Bonded Shield only blocks the <b>FIRST</b> attack of an enemy. If the enemy is doubling you, Bonded Shield will only negate the first attack and not the second attack. <br><br> 

2) Bonded Shield does not work on Lucina's Users themselves. This means that they are vulnerable to enemies with ranged weapons who might target them instead of their allies.

## Engage Attack

| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/lucina/FE17_All_for_One_Icon.webp) <br> **All For One**  | Use to make a sword attack against an adjacent foe. All allies within 2 spaces Chain Attack. |


|**Unit Type**|**Bonus**|
|Dragon| Chain Attacks have 100% Accuracy |
|Backup | Range+1 (All Allies within 3 spaces Chain Attack) |

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

Unfortunately for Lucina, she is saddled with the 2nd worst Engage Attack in the game. I say 2nd Worst because nothing can be worse than Leif's Quadruple Hit. <br><br>

<b>All For One</b> is an Engage Attack with several weaknesses holding it back. Firstly, you only make a regular attack with a sword and Lucina has no natural ways of increasing her offensive power in her kit. Secondly, the main power of this attack relies on having multiple allies with 2 spaces of Lucina's User. So unless you have a lot of your army bunched up together, don't expect more than 2 or 3 units to contribute to Chain Attacks. Lastly, the Chain Attacks triggered by One For All still have the fixed 80% Hit Rate of regular Chain Attacks, meaning they could miss. This makes the damage predicted in the Combat Forecast unreliable. <br><br>

However, All For One is not useless. Because it's an Engage Attack, the enemy cannot counterattack. So use this to soften up bosses so the rest of your army will have an easier time finishing them off. <br><br> 

The Class Bonuses are rather lackluster. Dragons having guaranteed Chain Attack accuracy is the only one worth considering as I do not recommend putting Lucina on Backup Units as that's a waste of Dual Strike. <br><br> 

All For One being mediocre isn't a bad thing. As stated previously, Lucina is a Support Emblem, not a Combat Emblem. But if you want to use Lucina as a Combat Emblem, you'll get more mileage from her Engage Weapons. <br><br>

</details>

## Engage Weapons 

| **Bond Lv.** | **Name** | **Might** | **Hit** | **Crit** | **Weight** | **Range** | **Effect** |
| l | ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/lucina/NobleRapierFE17Sprite.webp) <br> **Noble Rapier** | 8 | 85 | 10 | 8 | 1 | Effective: Cavalry, Armored.|
| l0 | ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/lucina/ParthiaFE17Sprite.webp) <br> **Parthia** | 17 | 95 | 5 | 14 | 2 | Double EXP while equipped. RES+3 |

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

Just as Lucina impersonated her ancestor Marth in her home game, Lucina's Engage Weapons all take heavy inspiration from Marth's. <br><br>

Lucina gives us the 3rd variant of the Rapier, the <b>Noble Rapier</b>. Compared to Marth's and Eirika's versions, Lucina's version has slightly higher Might but lower Accuracy. Unlike Marth's version, the Noble Rapier doesn't grant an evasion bonus. I consider Lucina's Noble Rapier to be the 2nd best Rapier in the game, behind Marth's. <br><br>

<b>Parthia</b> is definitely Lucina's best Engage Weapon as it is basically Marth's Mercurius in Bow form with the same Double EXP effect. Furthermore, that 17 Might makes Parthia excellent for shooting down Flying Enemies as it becomes 51 Might with Weapon Effectiveness. The +5 Resistance is the cherry on top as it can make Lucina's user a decent Mage Killer. And remember, this is a Bond 10 Weapon, meaning you don't have to complete Lucina's Paralogue to have this.

## Skill Inheritance 

| **Bond Lv.** | **Skill** | **Effect** | **SP Cost** |
| 1|Dexterity +1 <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/lucina/FE17_Dexterity_2B1_Icon.webp) |Grants DEX+1. |100 |
| 2|Dexterity +2 <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/lucina/FE17_Dexterity_2B2_Icon.webp) |Grants DEX+2 |300 |
| 3|Dual Assist <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/lucina/FE17_Dual_Assist_Icon.webp) |If unit is able to Chain Attack, unit will do so when allies attack foes unit could reach by moving. Trigger %=35 | 1000|
| 4|Bow Agility 1 <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/lucina/FE17_Bow_Agility_1_Icon.webp) |Grants Avo+10 at a cost of Crit-10 when using a bow. | 500|
|5 |Skill Inheritance <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/skillinherit.webp) |Unit can inherit this Emblem's Skills |Auto |
|6 |Sword Proficiency <br> ![pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/swordprof.PNG) |Proficiency with Swords. Required for Promotion/Reclassing to certain Classes |Auto |
| 7| Bow Agility 2 <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/lucina/FE17_Bow_Agility_2_Icon.webp) |Grants Avo+15 at a cost of Crit-10 when using a bow. |1000 |
|8|Bow Proficiency <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/bowprof.PNG) |Proficiency with Bows. Required for promotion to Certain Classes |Auto |
| 9| Dexterity +3 <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/lucina/FE17_Dexterity_2B3_Icon.webp) |Grants DEX+3 |500 |


<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>
Lucina's Skill Inheritance is reasonably priced all around. Some are cheap, others a bit expensive. <br><br>

Like Micaiah's Cleric, <b>Dual Strike</b> is not inheritable as that would allow you to turn anyone, not just Lucina's wearer into a Backup Unit. <br><br>

<b>Dual Assist</b> is the prize here and that 1000 SP price tag is more than worth it. Again, I heavily recommend spreading this around to as many of your Backup Units as they only need to reach Bond 5 with Lucina to inherit this. Again, please remember that only Backup Units benefit from Dual Assist. Putting on non-Backup Units is a waste of SP. <br><br>

Lucina's Stat Skill is <b>Dexterity+</b>. You might think that these skills would be great for patching up the hit rates of characters with mediocre DEX stats. But if you wanted to do that, you could inherit one of Sigurd's Hit+ Skills. <br><br>

<b>Bow Agility</b> is Lucina's Weapon Skill and it could be useful when combined with her Parthia. Or you could inherit this on an Archer/Sniper to stack with avoid bonuses they receive from their Covert Class type. <br><br>

Lastly, Lucina grants <b>Sword and Bow Proficiency</b>.

## Sync Skills

| **Sync Skill** | **Bond Lv** | **Effect** |
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/lucina/FE17_Dual_Support_Icon.webp) <br> **Dual Support** | 13 | Unit receives +5 Avoid for every Support Level with adjacent allies. <br>(None = 1, C=2, B=3, A=4, S=6) <br>(Max +90 Avoid) | 
| ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/lucina/FE17_Dual_Assist2B_Icon.webp) <br> **Dual Assist+** | 18 | If unit is able to Chain Attack, unit will do so when allies attack foes unit could reach by moving. <br> Trigger %=70. |

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

<b>Dual Support</b> is Lucina's final Sync Skill and a pretty interesting one. Its main purpose is to try and patch up one of Bonded Shield's weaknesses by making Lucina's wearer a better dodge tank. If you're using Alear as Lucina's Main User, this is fantastic for them because not only can they Support every playable character in the game but they are the only character capable of having S Supports. <br><br>

How Dual Support calculates the Avoid Bonus is simpler than you would think. It takes the Support Level a unit has with an adjacent ally and assigns a value to that level. It then multiplies it by 5. For example, say that Lucina's User Alear is surrounded by 4 Units. Alear has an S, A, B, and C rank Support with these 4 Units. Doing the math that would be <b>(6*5) + (4*5) + (3*5) + (2*5)</b> for a total of <b>75 Avoid</b>. <br><br> 

The real prize for doing Lucina's Paralogue is <b>Dual Assist+</b> which doubles the activation rate. This means that Lucina's wearer and any Backup Units who inherit this skill will be Chain Attacking almost constantly. This essentially means that enemies within Dual Assist's range effectively have at least 10% less HP. This damage really stacks over the course of a Chapter.

## Engage Weapons 

| **Bond Lv.** | **Name** | **Might** | **Hit** | **Crit** | **Weight** | **Range** | **Effect** |
| l5 | ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/lucina/ParallelFalchionFE17Sprite.webp) <br> **Parallel Falchion** | 10 | 80 | 5 | 10 | 1 |Effective: Dragon. |

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

Lucina's final Engage Weapon is her version of the iconic Falchion, <b>Parallel Falchion</b>. I find this weapon disappointing for multiple reasons. Its stats are disappointing by Bond 15 weapon standards and Dragon Effectiveness is pretty niche without assistance from another Emblem. Most of the time if I'm using Lucina's Engage Weapons, I almost always stick with Parthia. 

</details>


## Skill Inheritance

| **Bond Lv.** | **Skill** | **Effect** | **SP Cost** |
|11 | Strong Bond <br> ![Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/skillinherit.webp)| Unit stays engaged 1 additional turns (4 Turns) |Auto |

<details>
<summary> Explanation </summary>

Lucina's higher bond levels grant access to higher versions of Dexterity+ and Bow Agility. <br><br>

<b>Dual Support</b> might be a worthwhile inheritable skill. If you plan on using the character Pandreo, this Sync Skill synergizes scarily well with his Personal Skill, turning him into quite the dodge tank. <br><br>

<b>Dual Assist+</b> is the true prize here. Bond 18 might be a steep requirement for Dual Assist+ but it is very worth it. You might need to spend a lot of Bond Fragments or grind Skirmishes to get someone to the Bond Level with Lucina. Please remember that Dual Assist+ only works on Backup Units. <br><br>

</details>



# **Character Builds**

<details>
<summary> Knife Chain Attacks </summary>

One of the best ways of leveraging Dual Strike is on a <b>Knife User</b>. For a refresher, Knives in Engage are capable of inflicting Poison onto the target. Poison is a static debuff that adds "True Damage" to your attacks, +1 Damage for each stack of Poison up to +3 Damage. This applies to Chain Attacks inflicted by a Knife and this build exploits this mechanic. <br><br>

By the time you obtain Lucina, you will be entering a phase of the game where Enemy Bosses will have multiple health bars. Having a Knife Chain Attacker not only piles on the damage but also stacks on Poison to increase the damage as the battle rages on. Do this and you will be amazed at how fast enemy HP bars disintegrate as you keep fighting as the boss will constantly take an extra +2 or +3 damage from every hit. <br><br>

This build can work with <b>Thieves</b> but I prefer using this Build on <b>Wolf Knights</b>. Not only is Wolf Knight a great combat class with their speed and decent bulk but it is a Cavalry Class meaning they have increased movement for extra range with Dual Assist and their Class Bonus with Bonded Shield. Lastly, Wolf Knight is not a difficult class to obtain as it only requires Knife Proficiency (Obtainable from Leif or Micaiah) and either Sword, Lance, or Axe Proficiency, all 3 of which are extremely common in Engage.

</details>

<details>
<summary> Qi Adept Bonded Shield  </summary>

If you want to maximize Bonded Shield, the best way to do this is with a <b>Qi Adept</b> as they have a <b>100% Bonded Shield Activation Rate</b>. When you first obtain Lucina your only options for this build are <b>Framme, Jean, and Alear</b>. The latter two are Qi Adepts by default while Alear starts with Arts Proficiency and only needs Staff Proficiency from Micaiah or Leif to reclass into a Qi Adept. <br><br>

Alear is a very popular candidate for this build as not only do they support everyone in the game to maximize the effects of Dual Support, but their Personal Skill Divinely Inspiring (Adjacent Allies Deal +3 Damage and take 3 less Damage) synergizes incredibly well with Bonded Shield. <br><br>

However, once you gain access to Arts Proficiency through the Ring of the Instructor, you can run this build on anyone reclassed to be a Qi Adept as Alear performs well with other Emblems besides Lucina. 


</details>



# **Final Thoughts** <br>
Lucina is an Emblem that has become one of my favorites because she is so versatile. You can focus on using Bonded Shield to protect your army during the Enemy or focus on her Chain Attack Utility to shred through enemies during the Player Phase. As someone who loves to run at least 3-4 Backup Units in my army, her Dual Assist skills are a godsend for dramatically increasing their utility. Lucina definitely carves out her own niche while not stepping on the toes of other Support-focused Emblems. Definitely use her as she is very much worth using.
